<meta property=og:description content="Have you ever heard of the Puzzle Theory? No? Well, here’s an attempt at listing all the evidence that either cements it, refines it, or challenges it. If you have no idea yet what the theory even is about, be ready for a long, weird ride. And some Lovecraftian lore sprinkled in your favourite series, which so desperately tries to pretend that all phenomena taking place in it have a rational explanation, yet hides a very mysterious, quite strange and sometimes terrifying magic system rooted in the power of the mind.">

<!-- @ ending-fold -->
<!-- @ custom-fold @ Hypotheses -->
<h2>The puzzle theory supports the following hypotheses:<br><span style=font-size:.8em>(Click on the arrows if you wish to read details)</span></h2>
<details><summary><b>Puzzle Sentience</b></summary><p>Puzzles have some varying levels of awareness and are able to move around on their own. At&nbsp;least one of their active desires is to be solved, and they tend to seek out living beings in order to achieve this goal.</p><p>Most ‘hidden puzzles’ which are found by inspecting the environment follow this rule, and the puzzle guardians such as Granny Riddleton treat lost puzzles as if they were sentient beings in need of a home.</p></details>
<!-- Puzzles, due to being some sort of messy amalgamate of various thoughts lacking individuality and whose only main trait is to be puzzled about a specific matter, tend to gravitate towards consciousnesses which would be more likely to be able to solve them. If a puzzle finds someone who it believes should be able to solve it, the puzzle will not let go until it is solved and becomes satiated once it was provided with an answer. Sometimes some thoughts contained within the puzzle might dissipate upon finding the answer, sometimes not. A satiated puzzle may or may not want to be solved again by someone else soon after, or it may be satiated forever and only request to be solved if it senses the desire of someone nearby to solve it. -->
<details><summary><b>Puzzle Decay/Possession</b></summary><p>Puzzles can either spawn from, or merge with regular matter. They will distort over time the shape of objects they merge with, especially if it is the one they spawned from. The extent of this distortion may vary depending on multiple factors (for how long the puzzle has been present, whether the puzzle is related to the item it resides in), and may be either temporary, reoccurring, or permanent.</p><p>If the shape of an object appears distorted in an unnatural way (e.g. a straight line made from a rigid material started unexplicably coiling, whereas the material’s properties should cause the object to snap instead of curve), it may be a sign that a puzzle once caused its decay, or that one will soon spawn from it.</p><p>If an item has suffered from puzzle decay and the puzzle causing it has left, the effects of the item’s decay on its overall shape will become permanent; however, its physical properties (e.g. weight or sturdiness) will return to normal.</p></details>
<details><summary><b>Puzzles transcend Time and Space</b></summary><p>Puzzles can not only move around of their own accord, but they can also travel through both time and space thanks to their ability to create and burrow through <a href=#hivegap>Hivegaps</a>. The essence of puzzles, the nature of the fundamental particles which give puzzles their strange properties, are called in-universe <a href=#hamanier>“Hamanier particles.”</a></p></details>
<details><summary><b>Puzzles and “Thought Remnants”</b></summary><h3><i>The concept of “Thought Remnant” is a working title; it would be great if there were a canon term hidden somewhere, but if there is one, I have yet to find it. In the meantime, this designation has been chosen for the sake of clarity, as it is the most self-explanatory expression I could think of.</i></h3><p><i>Reading the glossary entries about <a href=hamanier>Hamanier particles</a> and <a href=hintcoin>hint coins</a> before this section is recommended for context and additional explanations.</i></p><p><b>In a nutshell: thoughts are tangible and can live on even outside of a living being’s brain.</b></p><p>Puzzles are born when thoughts with no owner intermingle and merge with regular matter. This hypothesis also suggests that ghosts can exist (thus creating a connection between Professor Layton’s puzzles and Ace Attorney’s spirit channeling), easily explains how the Detragan functions or why Dimitri’s time machine requires specific memories, and opens the possibility for reincarnation to be conceivable in the Laytonverse (thus explaining why Layton and Luke think that Melina could have been the reincarnation of the Queen of Ambrosia, or why Aurora genuinely believes she might one day be reborn as a human).</p><hr><p>This hypothesis offers the idea that the essence of puzzles, as well as the information contained within memories or any kind of thought, is carried through tangible vectors named ‘Hamanier particles’ in-universe; to some extent, a loose comparison could be made with photons and light (or more accurately, electromagnetism).</p><p>A lone such particle only carries some infinitesimal form of ‘pure inspiration energy’ and is by itself devoid of any complex thought, let alone sentience. Similarly, an ensemble of such particles can, if completely devoid of impurities, crystallise in the form of <a href=#hintcoin>hint coins</a>, which contain high levels of ‘inspiration power’ (ひらめきのチカラ) but do not think by themselves.</p><hr><p>According to this hypothesis, puzzles are formed when multiple disjointed thoughts, made tangible by the existence of Hamanier particles, assemble and merge with regular matter, thus bestowing unnatural properties upon inanimate objects. Not only this, but they also transcend language, since they can be solved by anyone in the world, even animals; meaning that the way puzzles are able to be solved is not through words, but rather through the same type of power as the ‘power of inspiration’ that hint coins possess.</p></details>
<details><summary><b>Plants/Fauna are WEIRD</b></summary><p>In part because puzzles are part of the ecosystem and laws of physics, life on Earth has either adapted, or incorporated in their metabolism the weirdness that comes with puzzles themselves.</p></details>

<p class=bar><span style=font-size:42px>Glossary</span></p><table class=glos>
    <tr><td id=clairvoy>Clairvoyance</td><td><p>Any living being, whether human, animal, or even plant or fungus, is more or less attuned to the surrounding presence of thoughts, which are conveyed in a tangible way through <a href=#hamanier>Hamanier particles</a>. Multiple characters are called “clairvoyant” in-universe due to having the capability to acquire additional information from these wandering thoughts, which can come from any location in the world or any moment in time.</p><p>The ability to understand and talk to animals is regarded as a form of clairvoyance based on the ability to detect thoughts emitted by animals, and convey the meaning of one’s words to them in return.</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td id=hamanier>Hamanier particle</td><td><blockquote><i>“Using a six-dimension alpha distributor, I was able to guide a concentrated stream of Hamanier particles through a temporal vortex, more commonly known as a wormhole. This stream of particles allowed me to divine the terminal points of the vortex.”</i></blockquote><p>This term was borrowed from the English dub of Unwound/Lost Future, more precisely from Dimitri’s speech as he explains the principle of his time machine. The theory assumes that the “Hamanier particles” which the time machine requires would be a fancy in-universe term for defining the kind of particles which allow puzzles to exist in the first place, and give them their strange properties.</p><p>The puzzle theory also refers to an ordered group of such particles (a structure composed essentially of Hamanier particles which interact with each other in a way such that the ensemble retains some information) as <b>“thought remnant”</b> for the sake of clarity, though this designation is only temporary and not used in-universe.</p><p>It is of note that the term “Hamanier particle” was made up by the English localisation, and that while the original Japanese text has Dimitri explain the phenomenon along the same principles, this vocabulary was not part of it. Still, due to being present in the official English version of the game, this English-exclusive term has been retained and is considered canon.</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td id=hintcoin>Hint coin</td><td><p>Hint coins, named <a href=https://jisho.org/word/閃き>ひらめき</a>コイン (‘Inspiration Coin’) in Japanese, are according to this theory a crystallised condensate of Hamanier particles in their purest form. While devoid of thought or sentience of their own, they are canonically known to radiate some ‘inspiration power’ (ひらめきのチカラ) which can be consumed in order to facilitate the process of finding new ideas.</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td id=hivegap>Hivegap</td><td><blockquote><i>“Once the magnetic field is firmly established, one has the ability to quite literally punch holes, or Hivegaps, into the very fabric of space-time.”</i></blockquote><p>Also taken from the English dub of Unwound/Lost Future, this term thus defines the entry point of a vortex through space-time. According to this theory, puzzles are able to spontaneously create Hivegaps in order to travel through space and time.</td></tr>

Original Text / Image	Translation (if needed)	Source	Relevant Arguments	Interpretation in regards to puzzle theory	Alternate, "realistic" explanations	Puzzle Sentience	Puzzle Decay / Possession	Puzzles vs "Thought Remnants"	Plants/Fauna are WEIRD
Collection item "Pièce énigmatique" (Un-inspiration coin)	"Un-inspiration coin"	Miracle Mask, collection item #39	Hint coins have psychic powers of inspiration	Made a whole tumblr post analysing this one. Hint coins and puzzles have psychic powers of sorts, and hint coins and are likely made of a peculiar material which can take various colours, while still being discernible as being the same material; hence why Layton & co first think that this coin might be a hint coin rather than any other kind of currency.	…Nope, nothing non-psychic comes to mind. The game description literally says that hint coins are supposed to have psychic powers.	0	0	5	0
Collection item "Ghost Husk"	Japanese: --- Translation: "A ghost's shed skin" - "What the, the shed skin of a ghost who molted…!? Questions are piling up but, I'll admit that it's lovely."	Miracle Mask, collection item #22	Puzzles "possessing" inanimate objects; ghosts being real	The (French only) description strongly implies that for Layton to question whether it is proof of ghosts existing, it has to do something supernatural-like, such as moving on its own. Layton is likely questioning whether this drape is possessed by a somewhat more peculiar than usual puzzle, or by something else.	…For real, why can't Layton tell whether it's a real ghost or a fake even once it is inside his collection box and he can look at it for as long as he wants?	0	5	1	0
Collection item "Tampon déroutant"	"A chaque utilisation, ce tampon imprime un cachet légèrement différent…"	Azran Legacy, collection item #7	Puzzle Decay ; Puzzles "possessing" inanimate objects	It is either a phenomenon of puzzle decay that is still ongoing, or a puzzle is hiding in it and distorts it in real time.	[Insert shrug emoji]	0	5	0	0
Collection item "Hameçon ornementé"	"On ignore si grâce à cet hameçon, ça mord. En tout cas, ça pique."	Miracle Mask, collection item #4	Puzzle Decay	Distorted from puzzle decay. Seriously, who would ever make a hook like this on purpose? And it would probably be quite hard to forge in the first place.	I guess it's an art piece?	0	4.5	0	0
Collection item "Trophée tordu"		Miracle Mask, collection item #20	Puzzle Decay	Distorted from puzzle decay. Despite the writings, Layton says that "nobody really knows for what competition it was made", so it would imply that the writings doesn't mention the competition? Either that, or the writings were distorted as well.	It's just a weird trophy whose plate doesn't mention which competition it was for. Either it was made like this, or it was distorted through strange means such as extreme temperature that partially melted it. Unlikely but… oh well	0	4	0	0
Collection item "Superbe amphore"		Miracle Mask, collection item #1	Puzzle Decay	Distorted from puzzle decay. The description says that it's "(reste d'excellente facture)", but if it is the case, why does it look distorted as if it had been cooked already distorted? Regardless of its age, an amphora will not change its shape in such way once it is already finished. It either retains its original shape, or breaks.	Whoever made this amphora several centuries ago cooked it in its current distorted shape. It's not very practical, but why not. I personally find this rather unlikely, especially since it has two [anse] including one on the distorted side.	0	3	0	0
Collection item "Canne noueuse"		Miracle Mask, collection item #2	Puzzle Decay	Distorted from puzzle decay. The description specifically says that it is unusable due to its "unharmonious lines" and the shape of its handle. The "unharmonious" part seems to imply that it was not meant to be some form of art piece.	It is, in fact, an art piece.	0	2	0	0
Collection item "Balance déséquilibrée"		Miracle Mask, collection item #14	Puzzle Decay	Distorted from puzzle decay. It is impossible to use this scale due to how untrustworthy it is, and its shape is described as "très particulière."	I guess it's an art piece?	0	2	0	0
Collection item "Morceau de fer peu commun"		Last Specter, collection item #16	Puzzle Decay	Distorted from puzzle decay. The sprite is pixelated and thus hard to interpret, but it seems to be a strange fusion between round shapes, tentacle-like protrusions, and multiple colours. It definitely shouldn't be referred to as "iron" alone.	The label is misleading, it's definitely an alloy of a lot of weird metals. Possibly not just metals, for that matter.	0	1	0	0
Collection item "Bandit manchot généreux"	"Ce bandit manchot permet de gagner à tous les coups. Quel est l'intérêt?"	Miracle Mask, collection item #21	Puzzle Decay	Distorted from puzzle decay.	Perhaps it was made by someone who genuinely wanted the casino to go bankrupt…?	0	1	0	0
Collection item "Graine mystérieuse"		Last Specter, collection item #14	Puzzle Decay	Distorted from puzzle decay.	It's a weird shape, but nature does regularly provide fruits or seeds with weird shapes. Not particularly outstanding.	0	0.5	0	3
Collection item "Ancre fragile"		Azran Legacy, collection item #3	Puzzle Decay	Distorted from puzzle decay. Not by a lot mind you, it's just a bit wiggly but nothing that makes it fully unusable. The description just says that it looks fragile.	It isn't even that distorted in the first place ngl	0	0.5	0	0
Collection item "Cube captivant"	"Ce cube d'origine inconnue émet en permanence des lueurs multicolores."	Azran Legacy, collection item #38	Puzzles "possessing" inanimate objects	Perhaps a puzzle is inside and active, or about to be created. Perhaps one day it will turn into a full-fledged hidden puzzle and jump at someone, begging to solve it.	A discarded toy that hasn't run out of batteries yet.	0	0.5	0	0
Collection item "Tournesol obstiné"	"Malgré sa nature, cette plante refuse de se tourner vers le soleil."	Azran Legacy, collection item #13	Plants are sentient ; Puzzle possession?	Either this plant is sentient and going against its nature, or it is possessed by a puzzle. By the way, it is described as a sunflower, but it also looks like the Enigmacia from Unwound Future (Beasly's flower), which also happened to be sprouting in a dark place. Perhaps the Enigmacia species doesn't like sunlight?	Thanks to Illusory Forest, it is canon that plants are sentient, at least some of them. Perhaps this one just has a personality going against its nature, or it is part of a different species (see Enigmacia from the left).	0	0.5	0	5

		Curious Village, puzle #?	Puzzles moving on their own	How do you fit a matchstick puzzle up there? Answer could be that the matchsticks aren't actually real and it's a living puzzle who just decided to perch on it.		3	0	1	0
Collection item "Miel fluorescent" "Il ne faut pas se fier à la couleur, ce miel est excellent pour la santé." --- Japanese: サイケデリックハニー - いかにもあやしい薬品のような色合いだが、見かけによらず、栄養たっぷりなハチミツ。 --- Translation: "Psychedelic honey" - "A honey with the colour of a very dubious chemical, but despite appearances, it is full of nutrients."		Miracle Mask, collection item #10	Weird plants with weird properties	Perhaps the fluorescence is caused by puzzle shenanigans, or perhaps not.

Try to find some way to keep track of the Azran lore.

- The Ancient Tree, one of the oldest trees in existence, is a clairvoyant being whose already great power has been enhanced by the Azran. It feeds on Hamanier particles, meaning that the above-mentioned process of dissolving the deceased’s thoughts especially is greatly enhanced in the areas where it has the most power. Its motives are mainly self-preservation, meaning that it is neither purposefully malicious, nor ever acting on good will. It can side with the golems or with the Azran depending on whose side will give it the most benefits (pretty much like Leonard Bloom).
- In Ambrosia, at the time ascribed by the legend, the royal family left on an expedition to Neverlace in order to find the Ancient Tree; king, queen, prince, and two soldiers, alongside others, left both the kingdom and the princess behind. The princess, later referred to as the queen of Ambrosia, knew little about how to rule a kingdom and was only supposed to keep up morale in the kingdom; a task which she excelled at, as she actually was kind and caring. As the rest of the royal family did not return in years, the people grew fond of their “acting queen” and were devastated when she fell ill.
- At the end of the Azran civilisation, when the golems started asking for freedom, the Ancient Tree decided that it also would like to have freedom. When the Azran refused to give rights to the golems, the Tree thus sided with the golems and gave them an advantage in the war that ensued, all the while ensuring that none would be able to reach the places from which anyone could control it.
- Somewhere in the 7th century CE, the Holy Mother (AA) was killed by the Ancient Tree, preventing the Khurain technique from being born.
- The previous St Mystere was “nuked” by the Ancient Tree when Elizabeth Riddleton, an immensely powerful clairvoyant who used to live there, deduced that the Tree existed through her powers and came to think that it should be eradicated. The Ancient Tree, seeing her as a threat, attempted to kill her; but their conflicting psychic powers only ended destroying the town and most of its inhabitants. Only Bruno, Augustus and Violet Reinhold, and her were left alive.
- The Ancient Tree’s current only “weakness” nowadays would be the Azran devices which were created in order to give it its enhancements, but also have near-complete control over it. Aside from self-preservation, one of the Ancient Tree’s rare desires would be to get rid of those shackles and gain full freedom. The Mask of Chaos/Order, which is required in order to operate the Infinity Vault, is one such artifact which has absolute authority over the Tree.

<p><h1>How Puzzles and Hint Coins work: A Theory</h1><h2>Also known as the shitpost headcanon that started off as a joke but ended up getting way too much supporting evidence in the games</h2><h3><a href="https://lutiaslayton.tumblr.com/post/706386034724831232">A Follow-Up to this Post</a></h3>

<p><b>Disclaimer²:</b>I am not going to consider that <i>every</i> puzzle in the game works like this. Some puzzles can be easily explained in-universe with normal, realistic physics such as “I heard this riddle the other day and it does not require complex visuals to solve, just listening to the question is enough to solve it” (this includes a lot of CV puzzles) or “I need to get across this gap/river/frozen lake somehow, let me think which path I should take for this to work” (for example, the puzzle in DB where Layton and Luke cross the frozen lake near the castle, or the one in AL where Layton jumps from boat to boat in Kodh). The sections of MM taking place in the Akbadain ruins where Hershel and Randall have to proress through traps and mummies are, in my opinion, this exact type of puzzle, even though the gameplay doesn’t consider them as actual puzzles.</p>

<p><b>Disclaimer³:</b>If you have not read the previous post exchange, the TL;DR version is that this theory/headcanon relies on the Japan-exclusive novel <i>Professor Layton and the Illusory Forest</i>.</p>

<hr><h2>What is canon about puzzles in general:</h2>

<ul><li>Some puzzles, like hint coins, can be carried around and hidden in inconspicuous places (inside a drawer, in a tree, <i>somehow hanging in a chandelier even though it’s a match puzzle that has no way of being able to keep its balance if it were a regular box with matches—</i>).</li>
<li>Not all, but a lot of hidden puzzles (puzzles that are not given by NPCs, but rather happen just because you looked in a place where you would have expected a hint coin, but the characters go “Oh! A hidden puzzle :D” instead) are on the similar caliber as match puzzles or sliding puzzles, meaning that it would be very unlikely for them to simply be puzzles printed on flyers or sheets of paper.</li>
<li>Puzzles that are not solved before a certain point in the story will move to the game’s Puzzle Guardian. The most rational explanation is that said Puzzle Guardian gathered them, no matter the type of puzzle, and store them in Granny Riddleton’s tiny house, or in Beasley’s flower, or in… wherever Keats keeps the puzzles. However, comments such as Beasley’s imply that puzzles may actually come to them by themselves, on their own volition.</li>
<li>The Puzzle Guardians often imply that puzzles (or at least some of them) are at least partially sentient. Somehow.</li>

</ul><h2>What is canon about the Illusory Forest:</h2>

<ul><li>At the core of the Illusory Forest lies a different kind of forest, made of mechanical trees which are all connected in the same network. I will refer to these trees as a single “device” from now on, since they all act in unison and as a single entity.</li>
<li>The purpose of the You-Can’t-Tell-Me-This-Isn’t-Azran™ device contained within the Illusory Forest is to read “signals” all across the world (magnetic field and animals/people’s brain waves notably — the latter of which works in part with electromagnetic signals anyway), and use this data in order to record the past and write what happens in the present as it takes place.</li>
<li>The device is self-conscious, perhaps even sentient. To quote the novel itself, “In a way, [the mechanical trees making up the device] are alive.” It also has a few ways to defend itself, and will not hesitate to use them when it feels threatened.</li>
<li>Skimming through the novel again, I did not find blatant evidence in the dialogue that the device uses this already collected data in order to make a few predictions regarding the future; but the legends of the “Book of Fate” mentioned at the beginning of the novel say that it does contain information about the future as well. I would interpret this as the fact that the device doesn’t <i>know</i> the future (thankfully), but that it has the ability to compute a few guesses based on the massive knowledge it already has (guesses which can be completely wrong). It looks for possible outcomes to a few (bajillion) events here and there without actually recording these non-factual hypotheses in its database, if you will. To further justify this: I don’t know about you, but if I were a sentient machine unable to move around and constantly tasked with gathering information about the world, I would probably get bored after at least a few millenia and try to do <i>something</i> with that info, if only for fun. Trying to predict what could happen next might as well be it.</li>

<h2>The Theory in a nutshell:</h2>

<ul><li>The Azran Epileptic Trees™ sometimes have the magnetic-brain-wave equivalent of AI image recognition issues, which will lead the AI to get into an “Is it an orange? Is it a helicopter?” situation. When this happens, it will put a bit more effort into trying to solve the conundrum, and a puzzle shows up as a result. Whether the AI eventually manages to resolve the misinterpretation or not, the puzzle tends to linger until found and solved by someone else.</li>
<li>Hint Coins appear at random when the AI detects a strong sense of desperation from someone, kind of crystallising the sentiment in physical form (as such, I make the hypothesis that hint coins will not necessarily all look the same, and that those collected by people other than Layton will not have the image of a top hat on them). More often than not, the someone who made a hint coin appear does not realise that they did, as hint coins tend to appear in inconspicuous and hard to find places; but sometimes, they may manifest in more obvious places, or even right in front of the person who made it appear. <i>Yes I’m specifically thinking of the “a hint coin appears when you <strike>touch</strike> look at the moon” case here.</i></li>
<li>Hint Coins can only be used if the Forest knows the answer to the puzzle. Or else you give the hint coin to the guy next to you who has solved it faster than you. Or else you’re trying to solve Anton’s puzzle and you’re f*ed.</li>
<li><b>Bonus:</b> Since the Forest can make puzzles appear by accident, perhaps it also has learned to make it happen on purpose. I thus make the headcanon that puzzles will sometimes appear as a defence mechanism when the Forest feels threatened; puzzles created with this intent will only appear in the Forest’s vicinity and will not accept Hint Coins (for obvious reasons).</li>
<li>The Puzzle Manifestation Process:<ol><li>The Forest detects a somewhat unusual situation and doesn’t know what to make of it.</li>
<li>Brain-wave energy™ converts air into somewhat more solid weird matter, similarly to photosynthesis.</li>
<li>Weird matter condensates into a little ball or something similar, and when you aren’t careful enough its shell explodes and it’s puzzle time.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul><h2>Now for additional details:</h2>

</ul><ol><li><b>Hidden Puzzles.</b> Puzzle manifestation cannot be triggered on purpose <i>unless</i> we are facing situation #2. Most of the time, puzzles only show up when the Forest comes across a situation that it misinterprets, or momentarily fails to process properly. It can be anything from a disorganised room causing unrelated items to get too close to each other, to the unusual pattern of a butterfly’s wings making the Forest wonder what it’s supposed to represent.</li>
<li><b>The “This reminds me of a puzzle” Rule.</b> If someone actually <i>wants</i> to see a puzzle appear, and if they have a clear idea as to what the puzzle should be like (e.g. it’s a puzzle they already solved in the past and remember almost all the details about it, but words without images are not enough to make it solvable), then the Forest may be tricked into thinking that the puzzle actually exists, and thus makes it appear. It is not required for this someone to already know the answer; in fact, if they are already facing a problem and think a bit too hard about trying to resolve it, the problem might sometimes turn into an actual puzzle (which, unsurprisingly, will drive a lot of NPCs insane).</li><li>Most experiments trying to purposefully make a puzzle appear under the conditions of situation #1 have failed, because the Forest reads the scientists’ brain waves and thus can unravel the purpose behind the disorganised mess of random objects that it would have, otherwise, likely had issues understanding. TL;DR the experiments fail because observers <i>expect</i> a puzzle to show up, but don’t know which kind of puzzle it could be and don’t want to influence the puzzle’s appearance on this front (which, if you take situation #2 into account, is a requirement for the puzzle to show up). Therefore, 90% of the time, the Forest will read their minds, understand that the messy pile of objects has no purpose other than “being a mess on purpose”, and will leave it at that.</li></ol><h2>Ok, that’s all well and good, but what does a puzzle of this kind even LOOK like?</h2>
<p>…beats me, I’m open to your suggestions. All I can say is that if we look at Randall (image 1 in the beginning of the post), they can be carried around and littered in the environnent like small items or rubbish. So… tiny little shiny balls that contain and release a puzzle like poké balls? Magic half-sentient bug-like devices <a href="https://lutiaskokopelli.tumblr.com/post/173061252801/so-hey-everyone-as-i-said-i-started-working-on">like I had theorised back in 2018</a>?? Ethereal half-tangible elder god thingies that transcend time and space???</p>
<p>What even happens when you trigger a puzzle? Does the puzzle bend reality in a fixed radius? Does it make the person activating it hallucinate the puzzle through brain-wave shenanigans and though you can temporarily quit, it will haunt you in the back of your mind and the only way to permanently get rid of this hallucination once and for all is to solve it?</p>

<p>WRITE SOMETHING ABOUT THE COLLECTION IN LS/MM/AL</p>
<p>It is only available until the end of AL: aka, until after the Sanctuary is deactivated. Not all, but at least a third or even half of the items are distorted compared to what an ordinary version should be—and in some cases, like the harpoon, it is <i>very</i> distorted. I am talking Junji Itô levels of distorted. Some items, on top of that, display properties that do not necessarily defy physics, but definitely toy with them a bit: a sunflower that uses everything in its power to look away from the sun? A stamp that never prints the same pattern twice? A ballon that deflects light and may look invisible in daylight? Yeah. Totally normal.</p>

<h2>Unsolved Mysteries / Up to Interpretation:</h2>

<h3>Picarats</h3>
<p>You can consider them canon or not, judging from the fact that as far as I am aware, there is only one (1) character in the entire series who mentions them, and that is Lucy from Curious Village saying something along the lines of “I bet you a million picarats that I’m right!”</p></p>

================================================================================================================================

Hello, welcome back to this series of insanity! We left off with Luke finding out that he has to solve a puzzle in order to locate St. Mystere, and with him being strangely taken aback by it despite the fact that he has already done that many, many times before. I had left a few cryptic messages implying that I had a little idea, but that I wanted to wait to encounter more tangible evidence before talking about it.

Well. If you are subscribed to this blog, you already know that tangible evidence did, in fact, show up. If you are not, do not worry, you can read the quick news [right here].

I will now, thanks to the tools I have, reveal the entire dialogue in this scene in all languages available, just in case there was a translation error, or just in case we missed something even bigger:

I could have tried to hold off on this until we reached that point in the game, but consider: since this playthrough is going for 100% completion, this means that we will never send a single puzzle to her. Which means taking the risk of missing something important. Such as... Well, exactly what this post from [a few days ago] revealed. Besides, in the last post I did talk about and showed an excerpt of Emmy's letter. The rule is simple: if it is relevant to the current matter, then it is probably better to talk about it as soon as it brings something constructive to the conversation.

About Deduction

<h2>Or why you want to subvert expectations through better red herrings, not through “better” plot twists</h2>

<p>So, I was recently reminded of an old post/essay I had written all the way back in 2017, and although it is quite dated, I figured that the points it brought actually still hold true to some extent. This blog is about Layton and thrives to encourage creativity, so I figured… why not give it a take two for the fellow aspiring writers who happen to follow this blog?</p>

#writing tips

Update on the Illusory Forest in case anybody was curious: I have the transcript of the part of the novel where they discuss some of the lore, and though I haven't made a thorough translation yet, here are the points I think I'm more or less confident about:
- The Illusory Forest’s Ancient Tree (there is apparently only one tree with all the knowledge) is not explicitly said to have been made by humans (not yet at least).
- It is said (in legend) to be the oldest tree in the world, nothing more, nothing less, and that it "holds super-knowledge."
- Knowledge is gathered because all plants in the world are capable of sensing living beings’ intentions through invisible electrical currents, and all plants communicate these intentions to the Ancient Tree, because it’s the oldest. The Ancient Tree is “tremendously potent” and capable of storing that information, and most likely also capable of understanding it.
- Aston and Luke make it sound like they believe it’s powers that belong to “the divine” or “the gods,” and that the Ancient Tree’s forest is a “sacred place where the gods dwell,” though they (at least Luke) are not putting any obvious sense of religion into it. They most likely just mean it in the sense of “something beyond our understanding.”
- The key to running the 'Tower of the Gods' are the five pendants that were taken out of the village 15 years ago, so the forest has not been accessed in at least that long.
- “The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you hear about the origins of the Ancient Tree and the Book of Destiny, you feel compelled to unlock its secrets at any cost.”
- The cursed dial Layton solved in the village is a route to the ‘Holy Land’ (Layton’s words). It’s a running board to get to the Ancient Tree.
- Need to do further research about the “Last Prince of Neverlace” and how he would have a known predestined fate.
- The legend/tradition/folklore mentions a prince, but also "Seven followers" serving him who are capable of communicating with the Ancient Tree by using plants.
