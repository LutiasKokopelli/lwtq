<meta property=og:description content="Have you ever heard of the Puzzle Theory? No? Well, here’s an attempt at listing all the evidence that either cements it, refines it, or challenges it. If you have no idea yet what the theory even is about, be ready for a long, weird ride. And some Lovecraftian lore sprinkled in your favourite series, which so desperately tries to pretend that all phenomena taking place in it have a rational explanation, yet hides a very mysterious, quite strange and sometimes terrifying magic system rooted in the power of the mind.">

<!-- @EFOLD -->
<!-- @SFOLD @ Hypotheses -->
<h2>The puzzle theory supports the following hypotheses:<br><span style=font-size:.8em>(Click on the arrows if you wish to read details)</span></h2>
<details><summary><b>Puzzle Sentience</b></summary><p>Puzzles have some varying levels of awareness and are able to move around on their own. At&nbsp;least one of their active desires is to be solved, and they tend to seek out living beings in order to achieve this goal.</p><p>Most ‘hidden puzzles’ which are found by inspecting the environment follow this rule, and the puzzle guardians such as Granny Riddleton treat lost puzzles as if they were sentient beings in need of a home.</p></details>
<!-- Puzzles, due to being some sort of messy amalgamate of various thoughts lacking individuality and whose only main trait is to be puzzled about a specific matter, tend to gravitate towards consciousnesses which would be more likely to be able to solve them. If a puzzle finds someone who it believes should be able to solve it, the puzzle will not let go until it is solved and becomes satiated once it was provided with an answer. Sometimes some thoughts contained within the puzzle might dissipate upon finding the answer, sometimes not. A satiated puzzle may or may not want to be solved again by someone else soon after, or it may be satiated forever and only request to be solved if it senses the desire of someone nearby to solve it. -->
<details><summary><b>Puzzle Decay/Possession</b></summary><p>Puzzles can either spawn from, or merge with regular matter. They will distort over time the shape of objects they merge with, especially if it is the one they spawned from. The extent of this distortion may vary depending on multiple factors (for how long the puzzle has been present, whether the puzzle is related to the item it resides in), and may be either temporary, reoccurring, or permanent.</p><p>If the shape of an object appears distorted in an unnatural way (e.g. a straight line made from a rigid material started unexplicably coiling, whereas the material’s properties should cause the object to snap instead of curve), it may be a sign that a puzzle once caused its decay, or that one will soon spawn from it.</p><p>If an item has suffered from puzzle decay and the puzzle causing it has left, the effects of the item’s decay on its overall shape will become permanent; however, its physical properties (e.g. weight or sturdiness) will return to normal.</p></details>
<details><summary><b>Puzzles transcend Time and Space</b></summary><p>Puzzles can not only move around of their own accord, but they can also travel through both time and space thanks to their ability to create and burrow through <a href=#hivegap>Hivegaps</a>. The essence of puzzles, the nature of the fundamental particles which give puzzles their strange properties, are called in-universe <a href=#hamanier>“Hamanier particles.”</a></p></details>
<details><summary><b>Puzzles and “Thought Remnants”</b></summary><h3><i>The concept of “Thought Remnant” is a working title; it would be great if there were a canon term hidden somewhere, but if there is one, I have yet to find it. In the meantime, this designation has been chosen for the sake of clarity, as it is the most self-explanatory expression I could think of.</i></h3><p><i>Reading the glossary entries about <a href=hamanier>Hamanier particles</a> and <a href=hintcoin>hint coins</a> before this section is recommended for context and additional explanations.</i></p><p><b>In a nutshell: thoughts are tangible and can live on even outside of a living being’s brain.</b></p><p>Puzzles are born when thoughts with no owner intermingle and merge with regular matter. This hypothesis also suggests that ghosts can exist (thus creating a connection between Professor Layton’s puzzles and Ace Attorney’s spirit channeling), easily explains how the Detragan functions or why Dimitri’s time machine requires specific memories, and opens the possibility for reincarnation to be conceivable in the Laytonverse (thus explaining why Layton and Luke think that Melina could have been the reincarnation of the Queen of Ambrosia, or why Aurora genuinely believes she might one day be reborn as a human).</p><hr><p>This hypothesis offers the idea that the essence of puzzles, as well as the information contained within memories or any kind of thought, is carried through tangible vectors named ‘Hamanier particles’ in-universe; to some extent, a loose comparison could be made with photons and light (or more accurately, electromagnetism).</p><p>A lone such particle only carries some infinitesimal form of ‘pure inspiration energy’ and is by itself devoid of any complex thought, let alone sentience. Similarly, an ensemble of such particles can, if completely devoid of impurities, crystallise in the form of <a href=#hintcoin>hint coins</a>, which contain high levels of ‘inspiration power’ (ひらめきのチカラ) but do not think by themselves.</p><hr><p>According to this hypothesis, puzzles are formed when multiple disjointed thoughts, made tangible by the existence of Hamanier particles, assemble and merge with regular matter, thus bestowing unnatural properties upon inanimate objects. Not only this, but they also transcend language, since they can be solved by anyone in the world, even animals; meaning that the way puzzles are able to be solved is not through words, but rather through the same type of power as the ‘power of inspiration’ that hint coins possess.</p></details>
<details><summary><b>Plants/Fauna are WEIRD</b></summary><p>In part because puzzles are part of the ecosystem and laws of physics, life on Earth has either adapted, or incorporated in their metabolism the weirdness that comes with puzzles themselves.</p></details>

<p class=bar><span style=font-size:42px>Glossary</span></p><table class=glos>
    <tr><td id=clairvoy>Clairvoyance</td><td><p>Any living being, whether human, animal, or even plant or fungus, is more or less attuned to the surrounding presence of thoughts, which are conveyed in a tangible way through <a href=#hamanier>Hamanier particles</a>. Multiple characters are called “clairvoyant” in-universe due to having the capability to acquire additional information from these wandering thoughts, which can come from any location in the world or any moment in time.</p><p>The ability to understand and talk to animals is regarded as a form of clairvoyance based on the ability to detect thoughts emitted by animals, and convey the meaning of one’s words to them in return.</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td id=hamanier>Hamanier particle</td><td><blockquote><i>“Using a six-dimension alpha distributor, I was able to guide a concentrated stream of Hamanier particles through a temporal vortex, more commonly known as a wormhole. This stream of particles allowed me to divine the terminal points of the vortex.”</i></blockquote><p>This term was borrowed from the English dub of Unwound/Lost Future, more precisely from Dimitri’s speech as he explains the principle of his time machine. The theory assumes that the “Hamanier particles” which the time machine requires would be a fancy in-universe term for defining the kind of particles which allow puzzles to exist in the first place, and give them their strange properties.</p><p>The puzzle theory also refers to an ordered group of such particles (a structure composed essentially of Hamanier particles which interact with each other in a way such that the ensemble retains some information) as <b>“thought remnant”</b> for the sake of clarity, though this designation is only temporary and not used in-universe.</p><p>It is of note that the term “Hamanier particle” was made up by the English localisation, and that while the original Japanese text has Dimitri explain the phenomenon along the same principles, this vocabulary was not part of it. Still, due to being present in the official English version of the game, this English-exclusive term has been retained and is considered canon.</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td id=hintcoin>Hint coin</td><td><p>Hint coins, named <a href=https://jisho.org/word/閃き>ひらめき</a>コイン (‘Inspiration Coin’) in Japanese, are according to this theory a crystallised condensate of Hamanier particles in their purest form. While devoid of thought or sentience of their own, they are canonically known to radiate some ‘inspiration power’ (ひらめきのチカラ) which can be consumed in order to facilitate the process of finding new ideas.</p></td></tr>
    <tr><td id=hivegap>Hivegap</td><td><blockquote><i>“Once the magnetic field is firmly established, one has the ability to quite literally punch holes, or Hivegaps, into the very fabric of space-time.”</i></blockquote><p>Also taken from the English dub of Unwound/Lost Future, this term thus defines the entry point of a vortex through space-time. According to this theory, puzzles are able to spontaneously create Hivegaps in order to travel through space and time.</td></tr>
