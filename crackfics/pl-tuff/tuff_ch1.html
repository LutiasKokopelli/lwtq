<div class=chcol><div class=chctn><div class=ch><article><h1>Chapter I<hr></h1><p class=em>Promising someone to meet a friend at their home, and going through with it, was usually quite trivial.</p><p>Now, bringing a shape-shifter with the tendency to transform with as much ease and lack of thought as they could breathe, from a laboratory in the busy center of London, to a small house that stood still in the same city, but far enough to warrant a bus trip and a good few dozen minutes, all this without catching the attention of any bystanders&hellip; This was much less so.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;You seem&hellip; <i>relatively</i> good at keeping Claire&rsquo;s form.&rdquo; Dimitri had been quick to observe.</d></p>
<p>Sure, whenever the topic of a certain Hershel Layton was brought up, the face of a man in a top hat would systematically resurface, for some strange reason; but otherwise, out of all the people they had impersonated during the past fifteen minutes, Claire&rsquo;s image was by far the one they could keep stable for the longest.<br>It certainly had to do with the fact that the original was right by their side, but it also certainly had to do with the fact that she had given them explicit consent to being impersonated.<br>That, and&hellip; by all means, the lady&rsquo;s spark, optimism and courage had completely won over the shape-shifter&rsquo;s heart and trust. Perhaps there was some &ldquo;wish to follow their model&rdquo; psychology hidden somewhere in there, even.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I could always pretend that I have a twin sister.&rdquo; Claire&nbsp;smiled mischievously. &ldquo;As for a name, if anyone asks, let&rsquo;s say&hellip;&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Celeste?&rdquo; they blurted out instantly.</d></p>
<p><d>She blinked. &ldquo;&hellip;Yes. Celeste. Why not.&rdquo; Raising her eyebrows in surprise, she slightly cocked her head to the side. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; funny that you would say that. I was thinking the exact same thing!&rdquo; She crossed her arms jokingly. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t happen to also read minds while you&rsquo;re at it, would you?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><i>That could explain the hat</i>, she didn&rsquo;t add.</p>
<p>Claire was trying to remain rigorous and rational, and kept telling herself that using a horror novella as reference was far from being a reliable source of solid evidence; but she was still reminded of the fact that the shape-shifting monster from the novel did, in fact, have telepathic abilities of some sort.<br>This combined with the fact that fifteen minutes ago, the real shape-shifter had only woken after she had made a brief physical contact with it, resulting in both of them receiving some sort of shock&hellip; It had certainly felt like a standard shock coming from static electricity, and so she wished to keep it at that; but she also did not want to disregard any hypothesis before they had been properly disproven.</p>
<p>Telepathy was a ridiculous idea to consider&hellip; But so was the idea of a being able to change shape within seconds, possibly ignoring the laws of conservation of mass in the process.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Well&hellip; Um, even twin sisters don&rsquo;t look completely identical, though.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Instead of answering her question, the shape-shifter had merely looked away and diverted the topic towards a different issue.<br>They were already copying her exact features, by now having truly reached a level of impersonation such that the only clue Dimitri had left in order to distinguish the two was, beyond their demeanor, the black pouch that only the impostor held. And yet, they closed their eyes and breathed deeply, which both scientists had by now learned to recognize as the signal that they were about to transform willingly &mdash; for a change.</p>
<p>Curious to discover what they were planning, but wishing not to disturb them in the process and end up with yet another accidental living nightmare, the humans shared a glance, then came back to look at them.<br>The copy of Claire&rsquo;s face hardly changed, but quite a few alterations were made around it. The glasses evaporated; the hair grew shorter and came to attach itself into a low pony tail; and the replica of Claire&rsquo;s lab coat was entirely replaced with a blue jacket, complete with a few more accessories. Finally, taking one last deep breath, a white straw hat laced with a green ribbon magically came out of their hand, as they put it on their newly shaped head.</p>
<p>The addition of the hat was most certainly so the shape-shifter could have something to hide their ashamed blushing face, and avoid meeting the eyes of others all the more easily.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;So, uh&hellip; How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>It took at least a few more seconds for Dimitri and Claire to overcome their shock.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s incredible.&rdquo; the man came first, genuinely impressed. &ldquo;Did you just imagine this from nothing?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Another question he would have gladly asked was how they could possibly have inorganic accessories such as glasses or hats appear and disappear in an instant; but he had seen it happen enough times already to have given up and simply accepted it for the time being. All that he knew was that these accessories seemed to directly come from the shape-shifter themselves, which&hellip; Well, he simply did not want to think too much about it. He had already gathered enough nightmare material for at the very least a month worth of his future nights as it was.</p>
<p>The one who would soon be called &ldquo;Celeste&rdquo; looked away, again, and pressed their hat to further hide their face.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve&hellip; seen it before. Just thought it&rsquo;d fit.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Once again, the two scientists shared a short, silence glance in confusion; but they soon shrugged it off.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Well, if you can keep it like this until we reach Hershel, it&rsquo;ll be perfect.&rdquo; Claire smiled.</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ll manage&hellip;&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Just relax.&rdquo; she assured. &ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;ve seen it, it only happens against your will when you&rsquo;re under stress; which, understandably, has happened a lot until now&hellip; But don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m sure we can make it.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>And she jokingly tipped off the impostor&rsquo;s hat in the process, leading to them instantly catching it and cowering under it.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Regardless, I&rsquo;m&hellip; not sure I&rsquo;ll want to keep that up for long.&rdquo; they admitted, once again their eyes darting away. &ldquo;The name, the outfit&hellip; It just doesn&rsquo;t feel right.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll only be for the trip, then. You can always figure something out later.&rdquo; Dimitri nodded.</d></p>
<p>If anything, hearing the shape-shifter themselves voice this type of concerns and insecurities was all the more reassuring to him as well.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;In this case&hellip; I suppose I will see you off?&rdquo; he added, somewhat shyly.</d></p>
<p>The shape-shifter jolted their head in surprise and confusion.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not coming?&rdquo; they asked.</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; probably not the best idea.&rdquo; Dimitri admitted. &ldquo;But I will be around if you need me, I promise.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>Once again, they looked away in shame. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because of me, isn&rsquo;t it.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>He bit his lip, seemed to want to say something; but he did not answer. Claire crossed her arms in contempt and disappointment, and he flinched slightly, but he did his best to ignore it.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; alright. I understand.&rdquo; they replied, somehow managing to bury their head even deeper within the confines of the straw hat. &ldquo;I&nbsp;wouldn&rsquo;t want to be around me right now, either.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The woman huffed in disdain and turned around, ready to walk out of the office and only stopping near the door. Dimitri eyed her discreetly, then gave them a quick stern look:</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;&hellip; To be entirely honest, that&rsquo;s hardly the whole of it.&rdquo; he confessed as softly as possible, praying that Claire wouldn&rsquo;t hear it. &ldquo;Just&hellip; don&rsquo;t ask. And don&rsquo;t tell her.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The fake Claire raised a pair of eyebrows in extreme surprise and confusion, but when Dimitri insisted that it was unrelated to them specifically, they were thankfully soon convinced and reassured.<br>He took the fact that they did not accidentally change their disguise as proof that they had been pacified, and smiled in return.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Good luck; but don&rsquo;t worry. You&rsquo;re in good hands.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The shape-shifter skittered to their double, only giving him a silent and grateful goodbye gesture before following her out.</p>
<p>The door closed&hellip; and Dimitri took a long second to close his eyes and sigh heavily. When he knew for sure that he was alone, he&nbsp;seized a chair and crashed into it.</p>
<p>So much had happened in such a short amount of time; he really needed a moment to himself so he could process it.<br>In the span of hardly an hour, he had found a mistake in their time machine&rsquo;s plans; he had run a full-on marathon while imagining all possible kinds of scenarios, most of which included the gruesome death of the love of his life; he had just <i>barely</i> made it in time to stop a major catastrophe; and to this moment, he was still overly conscious of how much of a close call it had been.</p>
<p>All things considered, the appearance of this mysterious entity of unknown origins&hellip; It was disturbing, yes, and the images would probably resurface in his nightmares for the following nights; but in the grand scheme of things, it had been just that, and nothing more. If anything, this phenomenon had been a blessing in disguise; he was now quite certain that this unexpected distraction was the only thing that had bought him enough time.<br>Besides, thanks to Claire befriending them, and thanks to him finding the strength to talk to them as well, he had quickly come to the conclusion that this moment had surely been far more traumatizing to them, than it had been to him &mdash; at least, when he compared the emotions he felt due to them with the ones he had been through just prior to it.<br>In a nutshell: the event he really needed to recover from was hardly this encounter, and the reason he had preferred not following them&hellip; had once again much to do with his own personal life, and with how he was not ready to board another roller-coaster.</p>
<p>Hershel was a good man. He knew this. Claire had made the right choice, and he wanted to support her all the way.<br>
So when she had made it clear that the one she truly wished to solve the mystery was Hershel first and foremost, not him&hellip; It&nbsp;stung, but he was happy for her. He&hellip; he needed not intervene. She was being polite and kind, as she always was&hellip; but contrary to what she would say, she didn&rsquo;t need him.</p>
<p>Besides&hellip; judging by the state of their time machine, a small explosion of some kind did, in fact, happen after all. It had been harmless, thankfully, far more than the one he had dreaded to find; but it still had created quite a mess.<br>Looking down, his feet came into contact with a pile of bent unhinged doors, and a multitude of disorganized papers.</p>
<p>This was yet another good reason to stay behind.<br>Someone would have to clean this up, after all.</p>
<hr class=bar><hr class=clock>
<p>With the sole company of the broom and debris, Dimitri still found refuge in the very welcome tranquility and silence. And now, with Bill having stormed off and Claire being gone to solve a mystery, he&nbsp;found solace in the idea that he would be able to empty his head in peace. He was appreciating his time cleaning up the office at his own pace, alone with his thoughts, and soon, he would gladly be able to call it a day.</p>
<p>The pile of papers had been put back in order; now was time to get to the heavy part. The doors would be quite difficult to lift up, and he certainly would not be able to put them back in place on his own&hellip; but he could at least deposit them in a corner of the room until the next day, so they would no longer block the passage.</p>
<p>Sighing in anticipation to the physical effort he would have to provide, he walked towards the messy pile of coppery metal, and&hellip; His gaze was quickly attracted to an unusual spark of green.<br>Curious, he came closer and crouched down, writing a mental note to himself that this was the exact spot where the shape-shifter had been found; and without hesitation, he picked up the item that had seemingly no purpose being here.</p>
<p>His eyes widened, intrigued. Measuring barely more than an inch squared, this was by far the tiniest floppy disk he had ever seen; but even more shocking than the small device&rsquo;s nature alone, what sent a chill down his spine as soon as he got to read it was the inscription printed on it.</p>
<p align=center><i>Professor Layton and the Unwound Future</i></p>
<p>Had he truly been able to recognize what exacly he had found and what this meant, he would have deduced how much this seemed to explain about the entity&rsquo;s unexpected knowledge, and all at once how little this would tell about why or how this could be; as the very existence of this tiny device should be impossible.</p>
<p>Fortunately, or unfortunately, he knew none of this; so instead, he merely frowned in confusion, vaguely deduced that it had to be related to either Claire or the entity, and pocketed it with the intent of looking at it later. Perhaps ask Claire about it, in case it belonged to her somehow.</p>
<hr class=bar><hr class=clock>
<p>By some sort of miracle, the travel went without a hitch. The entity had kept their hat low and their eyes stuck to the brim, which let them ensure that they crossed eyes with no-one. Claire at first had planned to fill the twenty minutes with some small talk, genuine or faked; but they had looked so strained and focused that she had soon given up, only ever speaking to whisper the bare minimum of information in order to guide them and let them know how close they were to their destination.<br>And so, for more than half of the duration of the trip overall, the&nbsp;only words that were uttered were <i>&ldquo;This is our stop.&rdquo;</i></p>



<p><d>&ldquo;Hershel, have I ever told you that I have a sister?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>Hershel blinked, taken aback. &ldquo;You never did.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The twins shared a look. The one in a blue jacket lowered her hat to cover her face, but he saw a very subtle nod of approval from her.
<p><d>Claire crossed her arms, her smile unreadable.<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Because I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>If anything, the confusion on the man&rsquo;s face only became all the more apparent.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;But then, who&hellip;&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing.&rdquo; the non-Foley woman uttered in shame. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Hershel was, by all means, dumbfounded and still in some way wondering if, perhaps, he was dreaming.<br>Claire saw that the cogs of his brain were now turning in vain, and stiffled a short laugh.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;We can explain what really happened, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; she assured. &ldquo;&hellip;If you let us in, that is.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>He jolted back to reality, instantly freeing the passage. &ldquo;I&mdash; my apologies. Of course.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The strange woman entered with precipitation and, once inside, let out a loud sigh of relief. As Claire followed and he closed the door behind him, he once again looked at the strange woman.<br>&hellip; Was it a trick of the light? It seemed like her hair had changed color, losing its ginger reflections in favor of a simple light brown.</p>
<p>Having seemingly noticed as well, Claire crossed her arms and jokingly stage whispered, ensuring that Hershel heard her words perfectly:</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Psst. Your disguise is falling apart again.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;W-what!?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>At the same time as this shriek, the one addressed jumped in surprise, and in the span of a single second, she had somehow gained more than three inches, traded her blue jacket for a longer dark brown one, and grown out of thin air an overly elevated top hat of the same color. The woman who no longer was one anymore, once back on the ground, completely froze and resolutely refused to turn back to face them.</p>
<p>Hershel stepped back precipitately, letting out a short but very meaningful yelp. Hardly recovering, his gaze instantly fell on his sweetheart, demanding an explanation.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I figured that there wouldn&rsquo;t be any way to possibly break it down to you slowly, so we might as well get it over with right from the start.&rdquo; Claire mused, now sporting a shameless devilish grin. Nudging his side with her elbow, she added: &ldquo;Besides, you&rsquo;re a fully fledged member of the screaming club, now. Congratulations.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;C-Claire, that&rsquo;s not funny!&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The stranger placated a hand against their mouth, realizing that the voice they had just spoken with had been just a little too revealing; and indeed, despite having turned their back to the couple, they very distinctly heard the young professor take another step back and gasp in shock. Ashamed, the impostor bit their lip and lowered the newly found top hat over their eyes; a top hat which Hershel now recognized as being strangely identical to the one he had just been gifted earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Claire walked to them and placed an apologetic hand on their shoulder. They locked eyes, and without a word, they transformed back to mirror her&mdash; forgetting to change her outfit. The man stared at one, then the other, back and forth, and a shiver ran down his spine when he realized that he had found himself unable to spot any difference between the two.<br>As his mind couldn&rsquo;t help but imagine all sorts of nefarious plans that could emerge from this, he became all the more thankful that the imitation&rsquo;s attitude revealed their intentions clearly. This made it much easier to distinguish them from the original, and this comforted him in the idea that it was very much their wish as well to not be confused with the one they were copying.</p>
<p>The fake one weakly raised their hands to look at them, saw the sleeves of a lab coat, then lowered them and sighed. Now staring at the floor, they silently walked away to a corner of the living room, facing the wall and slowly attempting to go back to the altered outfit of an alleged &ldquo;twin sister&rdquo; that did not exist.<br>Hershel wanted to look away as their appearance once again started shifting, this time far more gradually and slowly; but the spectacle somehow found itself so bizarre, that it could only cause in him some sort of morbid curiosity.<br>Without a word, Claire went back to his side and looked at him straight in the eyes.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;As you can see, Hershel, we have here some sort of shape-shifter.&rdquo; she muttered, this time truly with the intent of being quiet. &ldquo;They say that they used to be human, and we don&rsquo;t know where they came from or how this happened&hellip; But the fact is that they cannot remember who they were. So far, they&rsquo;ve only been able to mimic other people.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;They do not have an identity of their own?&rdquo; he mused, unfortunately still a bit too shaken to remember to lower his voice.</d></p>
<p>The shape-shifter in question had walked back to face them, as they appeared to have completed their newest transformation; but despite having settled on an appearance that had been shown to somewhat last, they preferred maintaining their distance.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Trust me, I wouldn&rsquo;t copy anyone if I knew how to avoid it.&rdquo; they&nbsp;lamented, raising an ashamed face in their direction, staring at him directly with a shining, trembling pair of eyes. &ldquo;But I just&hellip; I just can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Hershel raised a hand to his chin by force of habit, but he was at a complete loss of words.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;This has been a long day.&rdquo; Claire eventually uttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go make some tea, as I&rsquo;m sure we all need it.&rdquo;</d></p>
<hr class=bar>





<!--
&ldquo;How about Raphael, then? Raphael sounds nice.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hm, unless it should be <i>Raphaelle</i> with a double-L and E?&rdquo;
As they had made it clear soon enough, the name &ldquo;Celeste&rdquo; did not satisfy them at all. They were hesitant at the prospect of forging a new one from scratch, but since they couldn&rsquo;t find their own&hellip; At least letting them choose one was the best solution they had at their disposal.
&ldquo;I&hellip; think I&rsquo;d like to stick to an androgynous one. I mean, I can&rsquo;t even remember my gender.&rdquo;

While Hershel and Claire talk, Clay&rsquo;s eyes start diverging towards their surroundings, exploring the decorations of Layton&rsquo;s living room. Eventually, their eyes land on some small statues that he kept at the top of a shelf.

It reminded them of the infinite malleability of&hellip;
&ldquo;Clay.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Clay?&rdquo; Claire parroted, surprised to hear them after their long absence. "Do you mean, as in "Clayton"?" She turned to look at her boyfriend and laughed softly. "That would be a bit redundant."
"No, just Clay." They stared down at their hands. "I don&rsquo;t know, it just&hellip; seems fitting."
<p>The couple exchanged a silent look. Hershel stiffled a short breath as he turned back with a soft smile.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Alright then.&rdquo; he nodded encouragingly. &ldquo;It is a pleasure to meet you, Clay.&rdquo;</d></p>
-->

<!--
Layton will be the first to think about Clay&rsquo;s fingerprints as a possible clue to their identity.

Clay&rsquo;s fingerprints might have been altered without them realizing it during any of their transformations, but it is only a question of "might"; despite Clay&rsquo;s great sense of observation and 3D visualization of people, reproducing fingerprints exactly was never on their mind. And indeed, right at first glance, their and Claire&rsquo;s fingerprints look nothing alike.

"As perfect as your imitations will appear to the naked eye, it is still a disguise in the end. Whether made willingly or subconsciously, it is most likely impossible to be precise to such extent, even for you."



"In fact, if you may&hellip; I might have a theory that would need testing."

Without a word, Hershel came to his desk, searched a bit, then pulled out an ink (tampon pour mettre la date), a handkerchief, and three sheets of paper. Setting an example, he instantly dripped his fingers in the ink before pressing each finger on one of the sheets.
He handed out the ink and the two remaining sheets to them, and they complied dutifully, only borrowing the handkerchief at the end to clean off their hands.
With all three sheets of paper now filled with ten ink blots each, three heads went to hover the table in dread.
All three sets were completely different. Hershel sighed in relief, and gave a confident smile.

"You transformed into both of us, but your fingerprints don&rsquo;t match either; and they do not look like a combination of our fingerprints either."
"It might be a little too optimistic to say that they were never altered at all during any of your transformations&hellip; But I would say that there is a very high likelihood that these fingerprints are for the most part still yours; and yours alone."
Claire clasped her hands in joy, her smile now hanging from ear to ear.
"So we do have something tangible now!"
"It isn&rsquo;t much," the man muttered apologetically, "but it is a start. This is something to go off of. And&hellip;" He trailed off, looking in silence at the third person in the room with a soft gaze. Lowering his voice, he continued: "I believe that this is something they needed to hear."
Their hand trembling, the shape-shifter shyly reached out for the sheet which had been imprinted with the last remaining proof of their identity. The paper shook as they held it beneath their gaze, but they managed to carefully and neatly (plier) it, albeit with great difficulty. They brought it to their chest, holding it tightly.
In the softest, barely audible voice, the amnesiac stranger breathed some most sincere words:
"Thank you. Thank you so much."

When handing them to Grosky (or another inspector), he will comment on the fingerprints by saying that it&rsquo;s quite a rare pattern; one kind he did not actually recognize seeing before.
"Whichever criminal they belong to, they will not be able to hide for long!"

Aside from the cartridge describing a case that had no longer any reason to be, everyone was accounted for. Clay reasoned that it could simply be a simple continuation to the events so far; a continuation to what had already been a far too convenient series of coincidences.




"It is&hellip; quite strangely specific that you would remember everything about us, yet nothing about you."





The company Bill wanted to sell the plans to was Targent, and the generator originally let them build their massive tanks and flying helicopters.
In this timeline, instead&hellip; Bill finds himself more or less forced to build a time machine entirely for Targent&rsquo;s sake? (Well, more likely, he sells the entirety of the plans, not just the generator, and leaks to Targent every progress they make, each time for a bit more money.)

Clay: "Huh&hellip; He&rsquo;s still competing for politics? I thought he wouldn&rsquo;t have the funds."






When Clay learns that Dimitri hacked into PL3, they accept to explain the cartridge&rsquo;s purpose and show him that they have more.

"Would you&hellip; like to know?"
"You make it sound like there&rsquo;s a strong possibility that I wouldn&rsquo;t."
"Honestly, I&rsquo;m not sure." "You&rsquo;re curious and you&rsquo;ve already seen quite a bit, and it&rsquo;d feel good to finally have someone I can talk to when it comes to it&hellip;" "But at the very least, I&rsquo;m sure that you REALLY won&rsquo;t like it. Nobody in this world would."
"Not this world, you say&hellip;? Are you saying that this&hellip; and you&hellip; come from a different world of some kind?"
"That level of knowledge wasn’t manufactured here, that&rsquo;s for sure." they simply replied, their shoulders heavy. "I don&rsquo;t know how these things made it here, and I don&rsquo;t know how *I* ended up here either, but I doubt that anything good could come out of it if it fell into the wrong hands." "So far, I&rsquo;ve used that knowledge to try and make things better for everyone. But I&rsquo;m still thinking sometimes that I&rsquo;m playing with fire and that we&rsquo;ll get burned soon. I hope it&rsquo;s just my paranoia, but&hellip; How do we know that?"

"You&hellip; know what a video game is, right?"

They accept to show him the rest, and they even play a bit through the games. In fact, Clay ends up entrusting some to him for safekeeping? Or at least, Dimitri ends up keeping PL5 overnight because they both needed to hack into it for some specific kind of information.

"And&hellip; There we go." "You can get it back safely, now. I copied the data here&hellip; Now, all that&rsquo;s left to do is some digging." "I already did it once, it should be a bit more efficient this time."
"This game was made differently than the first four, though." Clay lamented. "UF was a regular DS game, but this one requires the 3D engine. Maybe the files, or maybe even the software entirely, might not work the same way."
"Well, we&rsquo;ll see about that."

Sadly, unbeknownst to both of them, Bill will find either the cartridge, or the data on Dimitri&rsquo;s computer, or both, and he will sell it to Targent for some extra cash.

Targent somehow gets a hold of PL5(&rsquo;s data?), and this is how they start a plan of their own. They amready knew(?) that the Azran looked up to the stars, or even beyond the confines of time and space; and with the cartridge as source and evidence, they managed to find the rest. They could download the data telling how to build the cartriges and the console, they made a few attempts, but only one was successful.
At the same time, they either kept a golem in their labs, or built one as an experiment; but in the chaos and confusion of a battle, the golem would end up being injected the entirety of the cartridges&rsquo; data. Then, once again SOMEHOW, the golem would end up running away with the pouch and through a time machine – probably getting damaged in the process and thus losing all memories of the event.

Clay learns that they never were human to begin with and has a mental breakdown.

<!--

When Claire and Layton remember that they were meant to meet up with Schrader and the Tritons, they offer to invite Clay as well, but Claire, and Clay especially, are a bit nervous. Clay admits that they&rsquo;re scared that they could accidentally transform again, in a public place no less; it had been difficult enough to reach his house in the first place.
Claire and

"Don&rsquo;t worry about me, please celebrate and have fun." Clay assured, a genuine smile on their face. "And, well. It feels a bit weird for me to say, because you&rsquo;ve always been a professor to me, but&hellip; Congratulations. You really deserve the title."

"What will you do in the meantime? Won&rsquo;t you get bored?"

Clay looked around and shrugged. "There&rsquo;s books. Probably puzzles. And there&rsquo;s my brain begging for some well awaited clean up."
"I guess I&rsquo;ll also try to&hellip; practice. I really want to be able to just&hellip; hold myself together. Literally."


Clay proceeds to create the London Life avatar, but soon, Layton barges in, because in all this mess, he forgot something important. He goes to his office, spends a few seconds there, then instantly walks out in a rush, trying to fit a tiny cubic box in one of his pockets. Layton notices that Clay saw, and feels embarrassed in turn. Clay raised their arms in innocence.

&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t snoop on my stuff, I won&rsquo;t snoop on yours.&rdquo; Clay nodded respectfully. Yet hardly a second later, they also averted their eyes&hellip; and the smile soon grew bigger, trembling due to a small repressed laugh of mischief. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m sure of it. You&rsquo;ve got this.&rdquo;
Layton&rsquo;s cheeks turned crimson. He blurted out a minuscule &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;, then ran out through the front door and slammed it behind him as fast as possible. Clay&rsquo;s toothy grin expanded from ear to ear without restraint.

-->


<!--

"Professor, I&rsquo;m going to give you a name, and&hellip; just let you think about it. We&rsquo;ll see if it rings any bell."
"I&rsquo;m listening."
Clay&rsquo;s lips trembled. They took a deep breath, then finally uttered the promised words:
"Theodore Bronev."
There was a long silence. At first, nothing happened; Hershel looked in the distance, deeply entranced in his reflection: some sparks of curiosity shone in his eyes, as if there were, indeed, some form of recollection slowly growing&hellip;
And then, the teacup fell to the ground.

Claire let out a gasp, instantly coming to his side and gently putting a comforting hand on his shoulder.
"Who is this person, Hershel?" she asked as softly as she could, trying not to rush him or distress him any more than he already was. "What happened?"
Clay lowered their eyes, watching their reflection through the trembling surface of their drink.
"It&rsquo;s his birth name. He&hellip; probably couldn&rsquo;t remember it until now."
"How do you know that, if even he did not?" "Hershel, are you alright?"

"During one of his adventures, he was supposed to meet his brother. That&rsquo;s how we learned about it in the first place." "Professor, your brother&hellip; He, too, currently lives under a different name. I think he goes by "Desmond Sycamore", now. And&hellip;"

"When we met him, his family had been killed years earlier by a criminal organization."

"I never got to learn when exactly it happened. For all I know, maybe it&rsquo;s already too late. But if they&rsquo;re still alive right now, if we still have time&hellip; I want to hope. I just don&rsquo;t know how long we have before it happens."

&ldquo;We already got past the point of no return when I stopped the experiment. Though it was an accident, I averted the deaths of ten people today.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I say we do it again. On purpose, this time.&rdquo;



# Claire is very confused as to how Clay was able to change History already without having triggered any visible consequences so far.
&ldquo;If there were consequences on the time-space continuum to your actions, then we would have seen them already.&rdquo; &ldquo;I do not understand how this is possible for you to still be here, but&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;If lives are at stake and we do not have time to waste, I suppose that we might as well make the most of it.&rdquo;










Layton: &hellip;&hellip;&hellip; Do you have, per chance, any other unbelievable revelations I should be made aware of?
Entity: Well, uhhhh, yes, but you already look like you might need some time to digest what I&rsquo;ve already said, so&hellip;

Hershel stopped pacing, instead watching them intently with the most serious expression they had ever seen coming from him. Truth be told, they felt quite intimidated.

&ldquo;[name].&rdquo; he insisted gravely. &ldquo;Is there something <i>else</i> I also need to know?&rdquo;

Succumbing to the pressure, with their eyes darting away at the speed of thunder and their arms clutching their chest, they shyly blurted out two words and a half:&ldquo;Randall&rsquo;s alive.&rdquo;

The man froze, then tensed every muscle in his body, then threw his arms in the air and resumed his pacing twice as fast.
The shape-shifter brought their knees to their chest and muttered to themselves that, in their defense, they had tried to warn him.

"I don&rsquo;t know who any of these people are, but&hellip;" Claire whispered to them. "Is there&hellip; even <i>more</i> than this?"
The entity sent her a deadpan look. "I hardly think that right now&rsquo;s a good time. But if you <i>have</i> to know, I could make a list."

-->


<!--

During the same evening, or on the next day, Hershel and Claire had actually planned to celebrate Hershel&rsquo;s new position as professor by going to a fancy restaurant along with Andrew Schrader, Clark and Brenda. This is when they take this chance to also talk about the plans (though they might be too cautious to mention Targent by name) and ask about Desmond Sycamore.


"Luke can talk to animals, but&hellip;"
"Huh?" Hershel "Talking to animals&hellip; Is this really possible?"

Claire nudged him; discreetly nodded her head towards Clay; then gave him a deadpan look. In return, his boyfriend pursed his lips awkwardly before muttering something similar to: "&hellip; You make a good point."







&ldquo;&hellip;A bird could.&rdquo;
Schrader gave a small laugh. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good one. And you&rsquo;ll teach it how to pick locks, too?&rdquo;



&ldquo;Regardless, Luke is three years old.&rdquo; Brenda uttered sternly. &ldquo;I believe it should be beyond saying, but we are <i>not</i> involving him in this.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, but&hellip;&rdquo;
Their eyes darted away nervously. Hershel had learned to interpret this exact look as <i>&ldquo;I know something very specific that nobody else knows, and I am trying to calculate whether revealing this secret might be a gigantic mistake&rdquo;</i>, and in consequence, he took a deep breath and prepared himself for the bombshell.
The bombshell, indeed, came soon enough.
&ldquo;&hellip;I heard that he might have inherited it from someone.&rdquo;
Clark&rsquo;s face became white as a sheet. Everyone noticed.
Brenda stared at him in shock. &ldquo;Is <i>that</i> why you talk to the neighbors&rsquo; cat so often? And you never told me about it!?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I never told <i>anyone</i>.&rdquo; he corrected gravely. &ldquo;You would&rsquo;ve all thought that I was crazy.&rdquo;

<!--
When they are alone, &ldquo;Celeste&rdquo; will try to see by any means if they could possibly find a way to give themselves their own body&hellip; And their eyes will fall on the black case. Curious, they will open it, reveal that it contains a 3DS as well as six cartridges, and they will insert &ldquo;the blue one.&rdquo; They will boot up London Life&hellip; And see that all saves were blank. No matter, they could just as well create a new character from scratch.

<p style=Prof. Layton><d>First, you&rsquo;ll need to create your<br>character to get started on your new life.</d></p>
<p>They snorted. That sounded about right.</p>
<i>You could say that again</i>, they almost said out loud.

Copying a pile of pixels was far more complicated than copying a real live person; but they found respite in the idea that, at least, this left the image with more than enough freedom for them to simply imagine their own missing details.
They closed their eyes. Took a deep breath. Stood up from the couch and walked to a mirror&hellip;
The person staring back at them was unrecognizeable. It did fit their expectations, it did come from the pile of pixels that they had taken as inspiration, and it did look nothing like any of the people they had previously met, or expected to ever meet in the future; but&hellip; It simply didn&rsquo;t feel like &ldquo;them&ldquo;, either.
Still. Being a &ldquo;nobody&ldquo; definitely was an improvement compared to being &ldquo;someone else.&ldquo;

(Layton arrives, startling them. They turn around, mutter &ldquo;&hellip;Professor.&ldquo;, once again making Layton cringe a bit. The surprise was enough for their disguise to partially decompose, their hair changing color and a top hat suddenly raising from thin air. Sighing, they squinted up at the new addition, carefully removed it from their head, and held it against their chest.)
Layton gave them a deep, empathizing look, keeping his silence. As he was about to turn back, saying that he would give them some space, he noticed the strange device laying on the couch. As the shape-shifter followed his eyes and found that they had stupidly left everything blatantly open for everyone to see, they rushed to it and crammed the spread out cartridges back into the case (<i>they had his name written on them, they had to go first</i>), before seizing the console and closing it. Embarrassment flustered all over their face when they turned to look sheepishly at the professor, who, if anything, seemed slightly amused.

&ldquo;I did not see anything, don&rsquo;t worry.&ldquo; he assured. &ldquo;I apologize if this was something private to you.&ldquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; not your fault. I&rsquo;m the one who wasn&rsquo;t cautious enough.&ldquo;


&ldquo;You will find it someday.&ldquo; he eventually muttered in a somewhat reassuring tone.
They stared down at the hat. &ldquo;Find what?&ldquo;
He repressed a short laugh. &ldquo;Yourself, I suppose. In more ways than one.&ldquo;
-->



<!-- Timeline:
Claire brings Clay to Layton, they say that they knew Layton from the future and was part of his team (forced to say it when Layton mused how many details they seemed to know about him personally).
Clay talks about Desmond Sycamore and how his family could get killed anytime between &ldquo;years ago&ldquo; and &ldquo;in a few years.&ldquo;

Layton says that the name &ldquo;Sycamore&ldquo; slightly rings a bell, but that he needs more info so as to know where to find him. He goes to ask Schrader, who can indeed give him Desmond&rsquo;s university.
Claire offers to go to a café with a view on the entrance of Desmond&rsquo;s uni, and wait there until they see Desmond come out. They talk a bit, and when Desmond does indeed walk out, Clay is ready to stand up and go meet him-- but Layton stops them. He shows them that a suspicious man with sunglasses who had up until then been standing immobile, pretending to read the newspaper, was now following Desmond. Layton confirms that Clay&rsquo;s fears were actually justified and that they need to find a way to rid Desmond of these stalkers, whi are, according to Clay&rsquo;s intel, most definitely Targent agents.

Layton asks Claire to pay the bill and bring Clay home safely, making sure not to follow them, and Claire agrees immediately. Clay is frustrated to be left aside as Layton goes alone, but Claire warns him that it is a matter of stealth, and that being three instead of one would actually play against them in this situation. Also, she trusts Hershel and knows that he will be careful and go home alright.

Layton is here for dinner, and has some semblance of a plan; but before they enact it, Layton wants Clay to be completely honest. Clay is thus forced to talk about the videogame.
Did the shape-shifter&rsquo;s appearance have anything to do with Bill activating the time machine? Maybe, maybe not. I have no idea and it heavily depends on whether it&rsquo;s conceivable for a time machine to cause weird shenanigans while it isn&rsquo;t even supposed to activate yet, which means that the answer is probably &ldquo;no, or else the machine would have likely exploded.&ldquo;
If I ever post this thing publicly (which is highly debatable), I think I&rsquo;ll stop the prologue at the moment when the lab scene stops and Claire offers to see if Layton can help solve the mystery of OC-chan&rsquo;s pretty much everything. And then put an end note saying &ldquo;hey if you&rsquo;re here to try and solve the entirety of the mystery of OC-chan, you&rsquo;ll find yourself in another Sherl situation. The short answer to the question &ldquo;How and why did OC-chan appear at this exact time and place?&ldquo; is &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask&ldquo;, the long answer is &ldquo;Maybe someday I&rsquo;ll find something, but don&rsquo;t count on it. This is a fix fic, not a &rsquo;look at my OC&rsquo; fic.&ldquo;
If you&rsquo;re here to stay, be ready, because many people are going to Not die very soon.&ldquo;
Be warned, people will be overwhelmed with much, much relief and happiness, and there will be a lot of tears (of joy).
-->



<!--
From that point onwards OC-chan is taking in what the situation is, is pleasantly surprised to realize that they accidentally saved a dozen people and basically erased the entirety of PL3 out of existence, and after Claire introduces them to a 27-year-old Hershel who is very much in love and about to have a happy marriage soon-ish, they decide to go &ldquo;hey while I&rsquo;m at it I already screwed up the whole timeline. Let&rsquo;s do more.&ldquo; And with Hershel and Claire&rsquo;s help the next step is &ldquo;alright let&rsquo;s save the lives of Desmond&rsquo;s wife and daughter so that he doesn&rsquo;t become a heartless grieving sadistic mess who wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to traumatize and hurt more. Also let&rsquo;s stop Targent because there&rsquo;s probably no way to do the first part of this plan on the long term without doing that too.&ldquo;

basically PL6 ~10 years early except Claire is alive, Emmy and Luke aren&rsquo;t here because they&rsquo;re still baby, and Desmond is not Descole
and they have that weird girl with that small rectangle thing that contains the entire movie of one (1) possible future that they would like to improve
(also that enters WTF territory but my dream brain also had an entire Mission Impossible sequence about &ldquo;ok let&rsquo;s get Desmond out of university and have him and his family move out of his house without Targent being able to track them down&ldquo; because Desmond was already being spied on by Targent with agents tailing him and microphones hidden in his office)
(and I hate that it relied on some WTF OC-chan magic but the plan was epic)

basically the one (1) WTF OC-chan magic element: shape-shifting because &ldquo;apparently OC-chan upon showing up in this world is no longer human but maybe some sort of Azran tech random thing who has no real identity of its own so yeah it can shapeshift&ldquo;

OC-chan explained the whole situation about &ldquo;yeah there&rsquo;s this one (1) possible future where your estranged brother gets his wife and daughter killed because of an evil organization and he kinda sorta becomes evil&ldquo; to Hershel, who devised a plan to get Desmond out and right here so they can meet face to face, while asking OC-chan multiple specific questions in order to make sure that the plan would work.
Thanks to Layton&rsquo;s intel and following the plan, OC-chan uses shape-shifting magic to get in Desmond&rsquo;s office in the university he teaches in. It&rsquo;s the middle of the day and Desmond isn&rsquo;t in his office because he&rsquo;s teaching a class, so OC-chan searches the room for possible microphones and stuff, looks around and out the window, and notices that, as they had feared, there&rsquo;s a mic in the room and a few Targent agents hiding outside. So next phase of the plan is: &ldquo;paper trail&ldquo;
OC-chan puts the mic directly on Desmond&rsquo;s desk so that it&rsquo;ll be the first thing he&rsquo;ll notice upon entering, and also writes a short message saying &ldquo;The mic is still on, so keep quiet. Don&rsquo;t turn it off or try to destroy it, it might make them realize that they&rsquo;re discovered. Also there&rsquo;s Targent agents outside but we have a plan to get you out.&ldquo;
OC-chan hides in a corner of Desmond&rsquo;s office and waits. After some time, as expected, Desmond shows up, sees the message, has a silent moment of shock, and then OC-chan shows up to once again sign at him to keep quiet. OC-chan gives Desmond a notepad so they can talk a bit in writing without having to speak out loud, and OC-chan summarizes the situation: &ldquo;I came here because of your bro, remember Theodore Bronev who&rsquo;s now Hershel Layton? Yeah he&rsquo;s waiting for you and he knows about Targent, also your family is possibly in danger so let&rsquo;s help you evacuate and lay low in a safer place.&ldquo; Desmond is highly suspicious and still has many questions, but he eventually agrees to the plan.
The plan being:
OC-chan gets to the nearest phone, calls Desmond&rsquo;s office phone. Desmond picks up and pretends that the one who called him is some random archaeologist who wants to talk to him about some new discovery over a nice dinner, and the discovery is so good that it warrants getting to a fancy restaurant that is literally at the other side of London. Coincidentally, the furthest way possible from Desmond&rsquo;s house. Desmond improvises some script while talking loud and clear, to make sure that whoever listens from the mic will hear everything.
Then phase two of the plan is that OC-chan &ldquo;disguises&ldquo; as Desmond and goes to the restaurant that Desmond mentioned (Desmond doesn&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s shape-shifting (yet)), while Desmond hides in the university for a bit, and then after waiting for 10-20min to make sure that Targent has left, he leaves to his house as fast as possible so he can warn his family, pack up his things, and go see Layton.

Meanwhile OC-chan goes to the restaurant, orders some random thing, pretends to wait for a bit, then eventually goes to the bathroom and uses shape-shifting magic in order to remove the disguise. Then they just walk out of the restaurant and past the unsuspecting Targent agents who followed them
anyway the plan went as smoothly as it could possibly have and now everyone&rsquo;s set and cozy in Layton and Claire&rsquo;s flat

also Layton decides that after dinner it&rsquo;d probably be a good idea to leave London entirely and go to a less conspicuous area, like&hellip; Hmmm Misthallery (thank you OC-chan for the suggestion)

but yeah i told you it was epic

The thought of Desmond being basically the damsel in distress who has zero idea what&rsquo;s going on and most importantly who this OC-chan is and how they know so much is the greatest part along with the plan itself
and now Hershel and Desmond are together on the same side and they have enough knowledge and time to possibly take down Targent
The only named character who still dies/is already dead that I can think of would be Rachel, and even then it depends on how early on she dies because I can&rsquo;t remember-->






<!--
&ldquo;So uh, just by showing up there, I kinda sorta accidentally saved Claire from certain death, and since the time machine didn&rsquo;t explode then the nearby buildings were also spared, which means that we shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about a vengeful orphan creating an entire futuristic London replica and eventually trying to destroy the real London in order to prove a point against corruption or something, and Dimitri also won&rsquo;t join him in his evil plan because since Claire&rsquo;s alive he has no reason to want to go back in time to save her&hellip; Oh, and I guess I also probably interfered with politics in some way, because I may or may not have stopped Bill from becoming Prime Minister too?&ldquo;
They felt the need to add:
&ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m complaining, all of those are GREAT improvements. Probably. Not completely sure about the politics thing, for all we know Bill&rsquo;s opponents wouldn&rsquo;t make good Prime Ministers either.&ldquo; &ldquo;&hellip; Was Bill even bad as a Prime Minister? I&rsquo;m not sure about the standards.&ldquo;
[&hellip;]
&ldquo;I literally did nothing by myself on purpose, but&hellip;&ldquo; They pursed their lips, still staring at the floor. Their gaze went back up, and they shrugged in the most undecisive way possible. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome?&ldquo;

Claire&rsquo;s mouth was still ready to eat flies, and Hershel looked like he could fall over any second.



&ldquo;All in all, I just actively saved one person&rsquo;s life, which also leads to saving the lives of a dozen more bystanders too, and in the long run we&rsquo;ve practically erased from reality a tragedy that would have happened ten years from now.&ldquo;

Everyone mused on these words, each weighing the parts of this sentence and all its implications.
After about three seconds and a half of active thinking, the shapeshifter raised a head to look back at the couple, and shone a devil grin that (thankfully not literally) sliced their face in half.

&ldquo;I say we do it again.&ldquo;

&ldquo;I-- It&rsquo;s been barely a week! How can anyone call me a &rsquo;professor&rsquo; just yet&hellip;?&ldquo;
&ldquo;No, no! By all means, keep calling him that.&ldquo; Claire laughed, smirking sassily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll need to get used to it eventually, so we might as well get started. Isn&rsquo;t that right, Professor?&ldquo;

<!-- At first, OC will pretend that they are from 10+ years in the future and knows of Layton&rsquo;s adventures -- soon being forced to pretend that they were present during the mysteries in question, so as to justify how they could have known so much.

Clark and Hershel are outside the uni, and waiting for Desmond to arrive. When they see him, Clark shows him to the bird and asks it to follow him.
Around five minutes later, a pair of windows are kicked open, the bird flies out in a panic, and a very angry Desmond throws his fist at it while shouting some rather non-gentlemanly sentences.

"Well&hellip; We found his office alright." Hershel muttered.
"Well&hellip; Now we know where to find his office." Hershel muttered, hiding his embarrassed eyes under the brim of his hat.
"Sorry, little friend&hellip;" Clark whispered to the magpie, gently stroking its shaking back.


"Huh? You said you found a camera?"
The magpie chirped proudly, revealing that it had indeed brought a small shining device within its claws and proudly dropping it in Clark&rsquo;s hand.
At first genuinely surprised, the two men&rsquo;s faces soon fell.
Instead of a camera, the men found themselves staring at a quite elegant, most certainly quite expensive and precious Coddington magnifier. A good part of the insults they had heard Hershel&rsquo;s long lost brother shout now made quite a bit more sense.

"&hellip; You did your best." Clark sighed.
"We will return it when we see him."

"There&rsquo;s something else?" "Something small and black that doesn&rsquo;t shine and seemed out of place because everything around it was bright and pretty, you say&hellip; Where was it?" A few more chirps. Clark&rsquo;s traits tensed, then he turned towards Hershel to translate: "Some place "high" and "rather well hidden." Probably at the top of a shelf, then."
"It might not be so, but it would be safe to go on the basis that it is a microphone, then." Hershel deduced. "This is not the worst case scenario, but&hellip; This will not be the most practical either." "We should also ask Clay to make sure that his telephone hasn&rsquo;t been taped."
"It would be redundant to have both a microphone and a taped phone, wouldn&rsquo;t it?"
"Of course." Hershel nodded, writing down more and more notes as they spoke. "Clay will look for this "black item that doesn&rsquo;t shine" first. If it&rsquo;s a microphone, we can leave it at that; if it isn&rsquo;t&hellip; Examining his telephone it will be."

<div class=chcol><div class=chctn><div class=ch><article><h1>(In Desmond&rsquo;s office)<hr></h1>

<p>The microphone he had found on his desk was indeed a genuine and perfectly operational article, and this element alongside the letter that his estranged little brother allegedly wrote had only come to confirm what he had recently started to suspect himself, without having been able to confirm it just yet.<br>As a matter of fact, the microphone had to be the most recent addition of all, because he was certain that had it been here for longer than a few days, he would have definitely found it on his own.<br>&hellip;<i>And</i>, in fact, for all he knew, that intruder could&rsquo;ve absolutely planted it in his office themselves, just to comfort his paranoia and lower his guard by gathering his trust through the disguise of &ldquo;helping&rdquo; him escape a threat that did not (yet) exist. What a cheap and overused tactic, yet what an often highly effective deception trick this was.</p>
<hr class=bar>
<p>As the archaeologist was pondering whether or not he should at the very least <i>pretend</i> to play along, the stranger had buried their glasses behind a notepad and started writing frantically. Soon, the paper was pressed right before his eyes.</p>
<p class=writing><d>It&rsquo;s too risky to talk but<br>we can use this instead<br>sounds good?</d></p>
<p>And at the same time as the intruder had showed him their message, they had also handed him a similar notepad and a pen. Desmond hummed thoughtfully, now seeing where this was going. He sighed at the idea of such ridiculous charade, but soon complied.</p>
<p>After a few quick seconds of scratching his paper at the speed of lightning, he turned his own notepad back to the intruder. In response, they glanced at it&hellip; then bent down to approach their face to the sheet as much as was politically appropriate. Then squinted their eyes until all that could be distinguished was a thin line. Then crumpled their face in such disillusion and disgust that they appeared to gain at least fifty years in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Ooh boy. <i>Right</i>. Layton&rsquo;s plan had sounded incredibly cool, epic, and flawless; but they had all forgotten to take into account quite a crucial piece of trivia:<br>
<i>Desmond Sycamore&rsquo;s handwriting was utterly illegible.</i> Whatever they could have imagined when first reading about it in any of the prequel trilogy games where it was mentioned and played for laughs, despite their selective amnesia, they simply <i>knew</i> that it looked even worse.</p>
<p>Catching on quickly, the archaeologist&rsquo;s face was in turn distorted by sheer annoyance and a very well contained boiling fury. He pulled the notepad back to him, scratched at the very least double the amount of words with even more violence than the first time, then soon revealed that this second message had been written in the biggest and most ridiculously emphasized uppercase letters as could be conceivable.</p>
<p class=writing><d>YOU HAD BETTER TELL ME THAT YOU HAVE THE MENTAL CAPABILITY TO READ THIS OR ELSE I SWEAR I WILL KICK YOU OUT OF HERE IN THE MOST LITERAL MEANING OF THE IDIOM.</d><d>AS I <u>SAID<svg class=u><path></svg></u>, WHO ARE YOU AND<br><u>WHY ARE YOU IN MY OFFICE?<svg class=u><path></svg></u></d></p>
<p>Honestly? Fair. If someone had barged into their room, shushing them and acting all secret agent-y and telling them to only speak through written messages because they were being spied on, only to then add insult to injury by having the very same intruder openly act judgemental towards their handwriting, they would be pissed too.</p>
<p>Needless to say, they did their best to not make him wait. They had the script memorized, thankfully, so the words came fast and efficiently.</p>
<p class=writing><d>Targent&rsquo;s spying on you &amp; we don&rsquo;t know how long you have left before they strike</d><d>I&rsquo;ll get you out of here without them knowing so you can save your family</d></p>

<hr class=bar>

<p>The next sentence he wrote was far shorter than any of the previous ones, and very much to the point.</p>
<p class=writing><d><u>HOW?<svg class=u><path></svg></u></d></p>
<p>Aha. Finally time to talk about the Plan&trade;.</p>
<p class=writing><d>In a nutshell<br>I&rsquo;ll provide a distraction</d></p>
<p>Desmond raised an eyebrow. Instead of writing, this time he simply showed his notepad again and insistently tapped the exact same question he had written last.<br>As an answer, they completed their former message with a single line:</p>
<p class=writing><d>master of disguise dw :)</d></p>
<p>Reading the additional smiling face at the end of their message only warranted an even more frowny death glare from Mr Edgy Man. Consequently, the intruder simply attempted to reproduce that very same smile on their real face, though it instead turned into a sheepish toothy grin.</p>

<!-- At one point, Clay will be hesitating and looking at Layton&rsquo;s notes in order to know what should be done in this very specific case; Desmond will hold his hand firmly, asking them to hand all the pile to him. He will find many pages of notes such as:

"Case A - 3.B : If there are cameras in his office.
-> Pretend to be a student in need of reviewing a manuscript

[When shapeshifter meets Desmond and he is losing his patience at all this nonsense]

If looks could kill, the sheer boiling steadiness of these two fiery eyes would be piercing a large round burning hole right through the shapeshifter&rsquo;s head. Indeed, by all means, Desmond Sycamore had a saint&rsquo;s patience.


[When the phone call starts]

The professor decided to wait for the second ring, so as to pretend that he was not expecting it. When he picked up and innocently asked who was calling, he did quite the good job at feigning surprise.

&ldquo;Your phone hasn&rsquo;t been taped, as far as I could tell.&ldquo; For the first very time, Desmond could finally hear that stranger&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;But keep following the script. It&rsquo;s better if you tell them where you want them to go.&ldquo;

Hah. So they could speak freely now, but not him? How wonderful. He truly adored being led by the nose with a carrot and a stick and being denied his free will. If this &ldquo;plan&ldquo; of theirs (well, which had <i>allegedly</i> been devised by his long lost little brother) were to disappoint him any further, he would gladly seize that small prankster teen and give them a good correction.


&ldquo;sorry professor but calling you by your first name would be heresy for my childhood&ldquo;
&ldquo;i have too much respect for you&ldquo;
&ldquo;desmond&rsquo;s alright though&ldquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;M OLDER THAN HIM&ldquo;
&ldquo;yeah but you ain&rsquo;t my second dad&ldquo;
&ldquo;sure you&rsquo;ve been a professor for longer than him but before you earn that title you&rsquo;ll have to work for it and balance out for that bad karma possibly-future-you has accumulated in a future we&rsquo;re trying to replace&ldquo;
&ldquo;Not a single word in your sentence sounded like English&ldquo;

<!-- Somehow, even the glasses were no longer the same, instead now perfectly matching his own. Indeed, had he not known for a fact that this had to be some masterful prestigiditation trick, he could have sworn that it really looked like the glasses themselves had changed shape.-->

<!-- <p><d>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; It sounds a bit assholish when you break it down like that, but the secondary motivation behind saving your family was so you wouldn&rsquo;t turn into a supervillain.&rdquo;</d></p>-->



<!-- When the moment comes when the 3DS&rsquo;s battery is running low, Claire will easily be able to figure out how to take care of it.-->
<!-- &ldquo;4.6V, 900mA? That sounds reasonable. It won&rsquo;t be perfect, of course, but I should be able to figure something out.&ldquo;-->



<!-- When Desmond learns that he may have become Descole: &ldquo;Yeeeaaaaah&hellip; That&rsquo;s also a big reason why we decided to act stat.&ldquo; &ldquo;You can keep the costume though. It&rsquo;s amazing.&ldquo;-->



<!-- Desmond deadpanned. "You asked. A BIRD. For help."
"Crows are far more intelligent than most give them credit for."-->

Later, Clay gets to meet Dimitri again, once they have found a pseudo-identity of their own
"Also, I have much better control over it now. All that happened last time&hellip; It shouldn&rsquo;t happen again."
"That&rsquo;s great!" Dimitri exclaimed, a genuine smile on his face. "I&rsquo;m happy for you."
"You&rsquo;re also relieved that I won&rsquo;t freak you out anymore, ha."
He bit his lip, looked away, then sighed heavily. "It&rsquo;s&hellip; Yes, that&rsquo;s true as well. I&rsquo;m sorry, it really was selfish of me. I know it must&rsquo;ve been hard for you as well."
"Don&rsquo;t be." "Claire&rsquo;s the unusual one here, not you. I really don&rsquo;t know how she does it."
Dimitri stiffled a short, loving laugh. "Yep. That&rsquo;s Claire for you."


Dimitri convinces Clay to let him borrow their fingerprints, pretending that he has some friends at the Yard that he could perhaps ask as well. Instead, he will compare Clay&rsquo;s fingerprints with his own&hellip;
<p>No match. Not even close.<br>Dimitri had never been so happy to get a puzzle wrong.</p>


Clay will ask him what he had called them for; he chuckles a bit in high relief and crumples the paper containing his own fingerprints, throwing it away instantly, apologizing for making them wait.

"Do you recognize this?"

"I found it the other day when I cleaned up the lab. I&hellip; was able to decipher some of its data."

"How much did you see?"

"Enough to end up with even more questions than I started with." he said gravely. "And enough to understand why you wouldn&rsquo;t want to answer any of them."
