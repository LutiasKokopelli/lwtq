<div class=chcol><div class=chctn><div class=ch><article><h1>Chapter I<hr></h1><p class=em>Promising someone to meet a friend at their home, and going through with it, was usually quite trivial.</p><p>Now, bringing a shape-shifter with the tendency to transform with as much ease and lack of thought as they could breathe, from a laboratory in the busy center of London, to a small house that stood still in the same city, but far enough to warrant a bus trip and a good few dozen minutes, all this without catching the attention of any bystanders&hellip; This was much less so.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;You seem&hellip; <i>relatively</i> good at keeping Claire&rsquo;s form.&rdquo; Dimitri had been quick to observe.</d></p>
<p>Sure, whenever the topic of a certain Hershel Layton was brought up, the face of a man in a top hat would systematically resurface, for some strange reason; but otherwise, out of all the people they had impersonated during the past fifteen minutes, Claire&rsquo;s image was by far the one they could keep stable for the longest.<br>It certainly had to do with the fact that the original was right by their side, but it also certainly had to do with the fact that she was the only person who had ever given them explicit consent to being impersonated.<br>That, and&hellip; by all means, the lady&rsquo;s spark, optimism and courage had completely won over the shape-shifter&rsquo;s heart and trust. Perhaps there was some &ldquo;wish to follow their model&rdquo; psychology hidden somewhere in there, even.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I could always pretend that I have a twin sister.&rdquo; Claire&nbsp;smiled mischievously. &ldquo;As for a name, if anyone asks, let&rsquo;s say&hellip;&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Celeste?&rdquo; they blurted out instantly.</d></p>
<p><d>She blinked. &ldquo;&hellip;Yes. Celeste. Why not.&rdquo; Raising her eyebrows in surprise, she slightly cocked her head to the side. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; funny that you would say that. I was thinking the exact same thing!&rdquo; She crossed her arms jokingly. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t happen to also read minds while you&rsquo;re at it, would you?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><i>That could explain the hat</i>, she didn&rsquo;t add.</p>
<p>Claire was trying to remain rigorous and rational, and kept telling herself that using a horror novella as reference was far from being a reliable source of solid evidence; but she was still reminded of the fact that the shape-shifting monster from the novel did, in fact, have telepathic abilities of some sort.<br>This combined with the fact that fifteen minutes ago, the real shape-shifter had only woken after she had made a brief physical contact with it, resulting in both of them receiving some sort of shock&hellip; It had certainly felt like a standard shock coming from static electricity, and so she wished to keep it at that; but she also did not want to disregard any hypothesis before it had been properly disproven.</p>
<p>Telepathy was a ridiculous idea to consider&hellip; But so was the idea of a being able to change shape within seconds, possibly ignoring the laws of conservation of mass in the process.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Well&hellip; Um, even twin sisters don&rsquo;t look completely identical, though.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Instead of answering her question, the shape-shifter had merely looked away and diverted the topic towards a different issue.<br>They were already copying her exact features, by now having truly reached a level of impersonation such that the only clue Dimitri had left in order to distinguish the two was, beyond their demeanor, the black pouch that only the impostor held. And yet, they closed their eyes and breathed deeply, which both scientists had by now learned to recognize as the signal that they were about to transform willingly &mdash; for a change.</p>
<p>Curious to discover what they were planning, but wishing not to disturb them in the process and end up with yet another accidental living nightmare, the humans shared a glance, then came back to look at them.<br>The copy of Claire&rsquo;s face hardly changed, but quite a few alterations were made around it. The glasses evaporated; the hair grew shorter and came to attach itself into a low pony tail; and the replica of Claire&rsquo;s lab coat was entirely replaced with a blue jacket, complete with a few more accessories and color changes in their general attire. Finally, taking one last deep breath, a white straw hat laced with a green ribbon magically came out of their hand, as they put it on their newly shaped head.</p>
<p>The addition of the hat was most certainly so the shape-shifter could have something to hide their ashamed blushing face, and avoid meeting the eyes of others all the more easily.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;So, uh&hellip; How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>It took at least a few more seconds for Dimitri and Claire to overcome their shock.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s incredible.&rdquo; the man came first, genuinely impressed. &ldquo;Did you just imagine this from nothing?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Another question he would have gladly asked was how they could possibly have inorganic accessories such as glasses or hats appear and disappear in an instant; but he had seen it happen enough times already to have given up and simply accepted it for the time being. All that he knew was that these accessories seemed to directly come from the shape-shifter themselves, which&hellip; Well, he simply did not want to think too much about it. He had already gathered enough nightmare material for at the very least a month worth of his future nights as it was.</p>
<p>The one who would soon be called &ldquo;Celeste&rdquo; looked away, again, and pressed their hat to further hide their face.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve&hellip; seen it before. Just thought it&rsquo;d fit.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Once again, the two scientists shared a short, silence glance in confusion; but they soon shrugged it off.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Well, if you can keep it like this until we reach Hershel, it&rsquo;ll be perfect.&rdquo; Claire smiled.</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ll manage&hellip;&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Just relax.&rdquo; she assured. &ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;ve seen it, it only happens against your will when you&rsquo;re under stress; which, understandably, has happened a lot until now&hellip; But don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m sure we can make it.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>And she jokingly tipped off the impostor&rsquo;s hat in the process, leading to them instantly catching it and cowering under it.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Regardless, I&rsquo;m&hellip; not sure I&rsquo;ll want to keep that up for long.&rdquo; they admitted, once again their eyes darting away. &ldquo;The name, the outfit&hellip; It just doesn&rsquo;t feel right.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll only be for the trip, then. You can always figure something out later.&rdquo; Dimitri nodded.</d></p>
<p>If anything, hearing the shape-shifter themselves voice this type of concerns and insecurities was all the more reassuring to him as well.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;In this case&hellip; I suppose I will see you off?&rdquo; he added, somewhat shyly.</d></p>
<p>The shape-shifter jolted their head in surprise and confusion.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not coming?&rdquo; they asked.</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; probably not the best idea.&rdquo; Dimitri admitted. &ldquo;But I will be around if you need me, I promise.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>Once again, they looked away in shame. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because of me, isn&rsquo;t it.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>He bit his lip, seemed to want to say something, but he did not answer. Claire crossed her arms in contempt and disappointment, making him flinch slightly; but he did his best to ignore it.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; alright. I understand.&rdquo; they replied, somehow managing to bury their head even deeper within the confines of the straw hat. &ldquo;I&nbsp;wouldn&rsquo;t want to be around me right now, either.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The woman huffed in disappointment and turned around in a single movement, ready to walk out of the office and only stopping near the door, waiting for the entity to join her. Dimitri eyed her discreetly, then gave them a quick stern look:</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;&hellip; To be entirely honest, that&rsquo;s hardly the whole of it.&rdquo; he confessed as softly as possible, praying that Claire wouldn&rsquo;t hear it. &ldquo;Just&hellip; don&rsquo;t ask. And don&rsquo;t tell her.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The fake Claire raised a pair of eyebrows in extreme surprise and confusion, but when Dimitri insisted that it was unrelated to them specifically, they were thankfully soon convinced and reassured.<br>He took the fact that they did not accidentally change their disguise as proof that they had been pacified, and smiled in return.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Good luck; but don&rsquo;t worry. You&rsquo;re in good hands.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The shape-shifter skittered to their double, only giving him a silent and grateful goodbye gesture before following her out.</p>
<p>The door closed&hellip; and Dimitri took a long second to close his eyes and sigh heavily. When he knew for sure that he was alone, he&nbsp;seized a chair and crashed into it.</p>
<p>So much had happened in such a short amount of time; he really needed a moment to himself so he could process it.<br>In the span of hardly an hour, he had found a mistake in their time machine&rsquo;s plans; he had run a full-on marathon while imagining all possible kinds of scenarios, most of which included the gruesome death of the love of his life; he had just <i>barely</i> made it in time to stop a major catastrophe; and to this moment, he was still overly conscious of how much of a close call it had been.</p>
<p>All things considered, the appearance of this mysterious entity of unknown origins&hellip; It was disturbing, yes, and the images would probably resurface in his nightmares for the following nights; but in the grand scheme of things, it had been just that, and nothing more. If anything, this phenomenon had been a blessing in disguise; he was now quite certain that this unexpected distraction was the only thing that had bought him enough time.<br>Besides, thanks to Claire befriending them, and thanks to him finding the strength to talk to them as well, he had quickly come to the conclusion that this moment had surely been far more traumatizing to them, than it had been to him &mdash; at least, when he compared the emotions he felt due to them with the ones he had been through just prior to it.<br>In a nutshell: the event he really needed to recover from was hardly this encounter, and the reason he had preferred not following them&hellip; had once again much to do with his own personal life, and with how he was not ready to board another roller-coaster.</p>
<p>Hershel was a good man. He knew this. Claire had made the right choice, and he wanted to support her all the way.<br>
So when she had made it clear that the one she truly wished to solve the mystery was Hershel first and foremost, not him&hellip; It&nbsp;stung, but he was happy for her. He&hellip; he needed not intervene. She was being polite and kind, as she always was&hellip; but contrary to what she would say, she didn&rsquo;t need him.</p>
<p>Besides&hellip; judging by the state of their time machine, a small explosion of some kind did, in fact, happen after all. It had been harmless, thankfully, far more than the one he had dreaded to find; but it still had created quite a mess.<br>Looking down, his feet came into contact with a pile of bent unhinged doors, and a multitude of disorganized papers.</p>
<p>This was yet another good reason to stay behind.<br>Someone would have to clean this up, after all.</p>
<hr class=bar><hr class=clock>
<p>With the sole company of the broom and debris, Dimitri still found refuge in the very welcome tranquility and silence. And now, with Bill having stormed off and Claire being gone to solve a mystery, he&nbsp;found solace in the idea that he would be able to empty his head in peace. He was appreciating his time cleaning up the office at his own pace, alone with his thoughts, and soon, he would gladly be able to call it a day.</p>
<p>The pile of papers had been put back in order; now was time to get to the heavy part. The doors would be quite difficult to lift up, and he certainly would not be able to put them back in place on his own&hellip; but he could at least deposit them in a corner of the room until the next day, so they would no longer block the passage.</p>
<p>Sighing in anticipation to the physical effort he would have to provide, he walked towards the messy pile of coppery metal, and&hellip; His gaze was quickly attracted to an unusual spark of green.<br>Curious, he came closer and crouched down, writing a mental note to himself that this was the exact spot where the shape-shifter had been found; and without hesitation, he picked up the item that had seemingly no purpose being here.</p>
<p>His eyes widened, intrigued. Measuring barely more than an inch squared, this was by far the tiniest floppy disk he had ever seen; but even more shocking than the small device&rsquo;s nature alone, what sent a chill down his spine as soon as he got to read it was the inscription printed on it.</p>
<p align=center><i>Professor Layton and the Unwound Future</i></p>
<p>Had he truly been able to recognize what exacly he had found and what this meant, he would have deduced how much this seemed to explain about the entity&rsquo;s unexpected knowledge, and all at once how little this would tell about why or how this could be; as the very existence of this tiny device should be impossible.</p>
<p>Fortunately, or unfortunately, he knew none of this; so instead, he merely frowned in confusion, vaguely deduced that it had to be related to either Claire or the entity, and pocketed it with the intent of looking at it later. Perhaps ask Claire about it, in case it belonged to her somehow.</p>

<div class=bar><span>August 28, 1953 &ndash; 13:38</span></div>
<p>By some sort of miracle, the travel was completed without a hitch. The entity had kept their hat low and their eyes stuck to the brim, which let them ensure that they would not meet anyone&rsquo;s gaze, whether voluntarily or otherwise.</p>
<p>Claire had at first planned to fill the twenty minutes with some small talk, whether genuine or faked; but her companion had looked so strained and focused that she had soon given up. Understanding and sharing their concern, she respected their choice and tried her best to not distract them; only wondering to herself why it was so hard for them to maintain a single appearance and why they wouldn&rsquo;t only ever transform by means of a conscious effort.</p>
<p>Surely, transforming had to consume some energy, which meant that this shifting transition mess occurring in-between two set forms was not their state of rest; so the reason why they could not stop these changes had to do with something else. It had to be their state of mind for the most part, and she hoped that there wasn&rsquo;t anything more to it than just that.<br>Hopefully, spending some time with her and Hershel and slowly getting accustomed to this new development would help them regain some confidence, and thus, self-control in that sense.</p>
<p>From then on, Claire only ever spoke to whisper the bare minimum of information, giving the shape-shifter basic directions and regularly letting them know how close they were to their destination. And so, for more than half of the duration of the trip overall, the&nbsp;only words that were uttered were <i>&ldquo;This is our stop.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>Hershel Layton, newly appointed professor at Gressenheller University of London, and only person to ever get this position at the sweet young age of twenty-seven.<br>This would be quite the heavy title to bear; but through his hard work and dedication, he truly had earned it. In about just a week, he&nbsp;would be back in university; but this time, he would stand on the other side of the desk, and at the very bottom of the amphitheatre.</p><p>Now, this hat&hellip; He could not deny Claire&rsquo;s good taste, and he could not deny this hat&rsquo;s refinement and elegance. But he would like it far more, if only he could keep it stable on his head. This would require some taking used to.<br>Hopefully he would manage it by the time of the celebration they had planned for the evening, and not ridicule himself in front of his friends and mentor. Andrew would definitely make fun of him if, at any point, he found himself with an imperfectly vertical hat; and surely, with such preposterous height, even a tilt of a single degree would be noticeable.</p>
<p>The man was taken away from his thoughts and mirror when he heard knocks on his front door. He pondered many options as to who it could be while he ran to it, and soon found the need to catch the brim of his top hat as he once again felt it fall off in his precipitation; but out of all the hypotheses he had formulated, finding not one, but <i>two</i> Claires, was definitely not part of the list.</p>
<p>The Claire who wore the same attire as the one she had when leaving him an hour and a half ago looked at his dumbfounded face and instantly started laughing. With this laughter and the other aforementioned hint, this could only be the real one.<br>As for the other, the one who seemed quite stiff and silent and who would resolutely try to hide her entire body within her white straw hat if this could be in any shape or form physically possible&hellip;<br>Who could this possibly be?</p>
<p>The outgoing one placed her hands on her hips playfully and gave him a bright confident smile.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Hershel, have I ever told you that I have a sister?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>He blinked, taken aback. He only realized now that he had not even taken the time to make this deduction, which in retrospect should actually have been quite obvious and easy to make.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;No&hellip; I am quite sure that you never did.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The twins shared a look. The one in a blue jacket instantly came back to lowering her hat in order to cover her face, but he saw a very subtle nod of approval from her.<br>Claire crossed her arms, her smile unreadable.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Because I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Alright, she had lost him. Where did he last put his hint coins again?</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;But then, who&hellip;&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing.&rdquo; the non-Foley woman uttered in shame. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Hershel was, by all means, the most confused he ever remembered being in his entire life. Due to the lack of context and the seemingly absurd setting, he started wondering if, in some way, perhaps, he&nbsp;was dreaming. Perhaps the top hat also was part of the dream, because certainly, who in their right mind would have the idea to make a top hat <i>this</i> impractically tall?</p><p>Claire saw that the cogs of his brain were now turning in vain, and once again, she stiffled a short laugh.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;We can explain what really happened, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; she assured.</d></p>
<p>Taking a short pause though, she playfully bent down and to the side to emphasize that she was trying to look behind his back. Smiling with twice as much mischievousness, she added:</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;&hellip;If you let us in, that is.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The young professor jolted back to reality and realized his mistake; instantly freeing the passage with a large side step, he mindlessly gestured the ladies to enter.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I&mdash; my apologies. Of course.&rdquo; he mumbled awkwardly, still dumbstruck by the absurd situation.</d></p>
<p>The strange lady entered first with great precipitation; and once inside, she instantly let out a loud sigh of relief. As Claire followed and he closed the door behind him, he once again looked at the nameless woman, trying to decipher her every traits.<br>&hellip; Was it a trick of the light? It seemed like her hair had changed color, losing its ginger reflections in favor of a simple light brown.</p>
<p>Having noticed as well, Claire crossed her arms and jokingly stage whispered, actually ensuring that Hershel would also hear her words perfectly:</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Psst. Your disguise is falling apart again.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;W-what!?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>At the same time as this shriek, the one addressed jumped in surprise, and in the span of a single second, she had somehow gained more than three inches, traded her blue jacket for a longer dark brown one, and grown out of thin air an overly elevated top hat of the same color. The woman who no longer was one anymore, once back on the ground, completely froze and resolutely refused to turn back to face them.</p>
<p>Hershel stepped back precipitately, letting out a short but very meaningful yelp. Hardly recovering, his gaze instantly fell on his sweetheart, demanding an explanation.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I figured that there wouldn&rsquo;t be any way to possibly break it down to you slowly, so we might as well get it over with right from the start.&rdquo; Claire mused, now sporting a shameless devilish grin. Nudging his side with her elbow, she added: &ldquo;Besides, you&rsquo;re a fully fledged member of the screaming club, now. Congratulations.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;C-Claire, that&rsquo;s not funny!&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The stranger placated a hand against their mouth, realizing that the voice they had just spoken with had been just a little too revealing. And indeed, despite having turned their back to the couple, they very distinctly heard the young professor take another step back and gasp in shock. Ashamed, the impostor bit their lip and lowered the newly found top hat over their eyes; a top hat which Hershel only now recognized as being strangely identical to the one he had been fighting to keep on his head for the past hour and a half.</p>
<p>Claire walked to the anomaly who defied physics, and placed an apologetic hand on their shoulder. The two locked eyes, and without a word, the shape-shifter transformed back to mirror her&mdash; forgetting to change her outfit in the process. Hershel stared at one, then the other, back and forth; a cold shiver ran down his spine when he realized that he had found himself unable to spot any difference between the two.<br>As his mind couldn&rsquo;t help but imagine all sorts of nefarious plans that could emerge from this, he became all the more thankful that the imitation&rsquo;s attitude revealed their intentions clearly. This made it much easier to distinguish them from the original, and this comforted him in the idea that it was very much their wish as well to not be confused with the one they were copying.</p>
<p>The fake one weakly raised their hands to look at them, saw the sleeves of a lab coat, then lowered them and sighed. Now staring at the floor, they silently walked away to a corner of the living room, facing the wall and slowly attempting to go back to the altered outfit of an alleged &ldquo;twin sister&rdquo; that did not exist.</p>
<p>Hershel wanted to look away as their appearance once again started shifting, this time far more gradually and slowly; but the spectacle somehow found itself so bizarre, that it could only cause in him some sort of morbid curiosity.<br>Without a word, Claire went back to his side and looked at him straight in the eyes.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;As you can see Hershel, we have here some sort of shape-shifter.&rdquo; she muttered, this time truly with the intent of being quiet. &ldquo;They say that they used to be human, and we don&rsquo;t know where they came from or how this happened&hellip; But the fact is that they cannot remember who they were. So far, they&rsquo;ve only been able to mimic other people.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;They do not have an identity of their own?&rdquo; he mused, unfortunately still a bit too shaken to remember to lower his voice.</d></p>
<p>The shape-shifter in question had walked back to face them, as they appeared to have completed their newest transformation; but despite having settled on an appearance that had been shown to somewhat last, they preferred maintaining their distance.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Trust me, I wouldn&rsquo;t copy anyone if I knew how to avoid it.&rdquo; they&nbsp;lamented, raising an ashamed face in their direction, staring at him directly with a shining, trembling pair of eyes. &ldquo;But I just&hellip; I just can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Hershel raised a hand to his chin by force of habit, but he was at a complete loss of words. He went through the entire scene once again, now with the answer to his puzzle in mind, and finally things seemed to make more sense&hellip; all the while raising twice as many questions as he had initially.<br>He exchanged a long stunned look with the stranger, and through the slightly altered face of his girlfriend, the stranger looked back with a hurricane of emotions. Soon, their hair seemed to gain some life of their own as they were raised in the air and changed color, and they yelped, instantly trying to cover the accident under the straw hat, instantly apologizing once the crisis under control.</p>
<p>The real Claire gave both a sad look, then invited them to sit&mdash; once again lightly putting a hand on the stranger&rsquo;s shoulder and gently pointing at the couch.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;This day is far from over, but it has been quite eventful already.&rdquo; she uttered. &ldquo;I&nbsp;will go make some tea, as I&rsquo;m sure we all need it.&rdquo;</d></p>

&ldquo;How about Raphael, then? Raphael sounds nice.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hm, unless it should be <i>Raphaelle</i> with a double-L and E?&rdquo;
As they had made it clear soon enough, the name &ldquo;Celeste&rdquo; did not satisfy them at all. They were hesitant at the prospect of forging a new one from scratch, but since they couldn&rsquo;t find their own&hellip; At least letting them choose one was the best solution they had at their disposal.
&ldquo;I&hellip; think I&rsquo;d like to stick to an androgynous one. I mean, I can&rsquo;t even remember my gender.&rdquo;

While Hershel and Claire talk, Clay&rsquo;s eyes start diverging towards their surroundings, exploring the decorations of Layton&rsquo;s living room. Eventually, their eyes land on some small statues that he kept at the top of a shelf.

It reminded them of the infinite malleability of&hellip;
&ldquo;Clay.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Clay?&rdquo; Claire parroted, surprised to hear them after their long absence. "Do you mean, as in "Clayton"?" She turned to look at her boyfriend and laughed softly. "That would be a bit redundant."
"No, just Clay." They stared down at their hands. "I don&rsquo;t know, it just&hellip; seems fitting."
<p>The couple exchanged a silent look. Hershel stiffled a short breath as he turned back with a soft smile.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Alright then.&rdquo; he nodded encouragingly. &ldquo;It is a pleasure to meet you, Clay.&rdquo;</d></p>

Layton will be the first to think about Clay&rsquo;s fingerprints as a possible clue to their identity.

Clay&rsquo;s fingerprints might have been altered without them realizing it during any of their transformations, but it is only a question of "might"; despite Clay&rsquo;s great sense of observation and 3D visualization of people, reproducing fingerprints exactly was never on their mind. And indeed, right at first glance, their and Claire&rsquo;s fingerprints look nothing alike.

"As perfect as your imitations will appear to the naked eye, it is still a disguise in the end. Whether made willingly or subconsciously, it is most likely impossible to be precise to such extent, even for you."



"In fact, if you may&hellip; I might have a theory that would need testing."

Without a word, Hershel came to his desk, searched a bit, then pulled out an ink (tampon pour mettre la date), a handkerchief, and three sheets of paper. Setting an example, he instantly dripped his fingers in the ink before pressing each finger on one of the sheets.
He handed out the ink and the two remaining sheets to them, and they complied dutifully, only borrowing the handkerchief at the end to clean off their hands.
With all three sheets of paper now filled with ten ink blots each, three heads went to hover the table in dread.
All three sets were completely different. Hershel sighed in relief, and gave a confident smile.

"You transformed into both of us, but your fingerprints don&rsquo;t match either; and they do not look like a combination of our fingerprints either."
"It might be a little too optimistic to say that they were never altered at all during any of your transformations&hellip; But I would say that there is a very high likelihood that these fingerprints are for the most part still yours; and yours alone."
Claire clasped her hands in joy, her smile now hanging from ear to ear.
"So we do have something tangible now!"
"It isn&rsquo;t much," the man muttered apologetically, "but it is a start. This is something to go off of. And&hellip;" He trailed off, looking in silence at the third person in the room with a soft gaze. Lowering his voice, he continued: "I believe that this is something they needed to hear."
Their hand trembling, the shape-shifter shyly reached out for the sheet which had been imprinted with the last remaining proof of their identity. The paper shook as they held it beneath their gaze, but they managed to carefully and neatly (plier) it, albeit with great difficulty. They brought it to their chest, holding it tightly.
In the softest, barely audible voice, the amnesiac stranger breathed some most sincere words:
"Thank you. Thank you so much."

When handing them to Grosky (or another inspector), he will comment on the fingerprints by saying that it&rsquo;s quite a rare pattern; one kind he did not actually recognize seeing before.
"Whichever criminal they belong to, they will not be able to hide for long!"

When Claire and Layton remember that they were meant to meet up with Schrader and the Tritons, they offer to invite Clay as well, but Claire, and Clay especially, are a bit nervous. Clay admits that they&rsquo;re scared that they could accidentally transform again, in a public place no less; it had been difficult enough to reach his house in the first place.
Claire and

"Don&rsquo;t worry about me, please celebrate and have fun." Clay assured, a genuine smile on their face. "And, well. It feels a bit weird for me to say, because you&rsquo;ve always been a professor to me, but&hellip; Congratulations. You really deserve the title."

"What will you do in the meantime? Won&rsquo;t you get bored?"

Clay looked around and shrugged. "There&rsquo;s books. Probably puzzles. And there&rsquo;s my brain begging for some well awaited clean up."
"I guess I&rsquo;ll also try to&hellip; practice. I really want to be able to just&hellip; hold myself together. Literally."


Clay proceeds to create the London Life avatar, but soon, Layton barges in, because in all this mess, he forgot something important. He goes to his office, spends a few seconds there, then instantly walks out in a rush, trying to fit a tiny cubic box in one of his pockets. Layton notices that Clay saw, and feels embarrassed in turn. Clay raised their arms in innocence.

&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t snoop on my stuff, I won&rsquo;t snoop on yours.&rdquo; Clay nodded respectfully. Yet hardly a second later, they also averted their eyes&hellip; and the smile soon grew bigger, trembling due to a small repressed laugh of mischief. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m sure of it. You&rsquo;ve got this.&rdquo;
Layton&rsquo;s cheeks turned crimson. He blurted out a minuscule &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;, then ran out through the front door and slammed it behind him as fast as possible. Clay&rsquo;s toothy grin expanded from ear to ear without restraint.

"Professor, I&rsquo;m going to give you a name, and&hellip; just let you think about it. We&rsquo;ll see if it rings any bell."
"I&rsquo;m listening."
Clay&rsquo;s lips trembled. They took a deep breath, then finally uttered the promised words:
"Theodore Bronev."
There was a long silence. At first, nothing happened; Hershel looked in the distance, deeply entranced in his reflection: some sparks of curiosity shone in his eyes, as if there were, indeed, some form of recollection slowly growing&hellip;
And then, the teacup fell to the ground.

Claire let out a gasp, instantly coming to his side and gently putting a comforting hand on his shoulder.
"Who is this person, Hershel?" she asked as softly as she could, trying not to rush him or distress him any more than he already was. "What happened?"
Clay lowered their eyes, watching their reflection through the trembling surface of their drink.
"It&rsquo;s his birth name. He&hellip; probably couldn&rsquo;t remember it until now."
"How do you know that, if even he did not?" "Hershel, are you alright?"

"During one of his adventures, he was supposed to meet his brother. That&rsquo;s how we learned about it in the first place." "Professor, your brother&hellip; He, too, currently lives under a different name. I think he goes by "Desmond Sycamore", now. And&hellip;"

"When we met him, his family had been killed years earlier by a criminal organization."

"I never got to learn when exactly it happened. For all I know, maybe it&rsquo;s already too late. But if they&rsquo;re still alive right now, if we still have time&hellip; I want to hope. I just don&rsquo;t know how long we have before it happens."

&ldquo;We already got past the point of no return when I stopped the experiment. Though it was an accident, I averted the deaths of ten people today.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I say we do it again. On purpose, this time.&rdquo;



# Claire is very confused as to how Clay was able to change History already without having triggered any visible consequences so far.
&ldquo;If there were consequences on the time-space continuum to your actions, then we would have seen them already.&rdquo; &ldquo;I do not understand how this is possible for you to still be here, but&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;If lives are at stake and we do not have time to waste, I suppose that we might as well make the most of it.&rdquo;


Layton: &hellip;&hellip;&hellip; Do you have, per chance, any other unbelievable revelations I should be made aware of?
Entity: Well, uhhhh, yes, but you already look like you might need some time to digest what I&rsquo;ve already said, so&hellip;

Hershel stopped pacing, instead watching them intently with the most serious expression they had ever seen coming from him. Truth be told, they felt quite intimidated.

&ldquo;[name].&rdquo; he insisted gravely. &ldquo;Is there something <i>else</i> I also need to know?&rdquo;

Succumbing to the pressure, with their eyes darting away at the speed of thunder and their arms clutching their chest, they shyly blurted out two words and a half:&ldquo;Randall&rsquo;s alive.&rdquo;

The man froze, then tensed every muscle in his body, then threw his arms in the air and resumed his pacing twice as fast.
The shape-shifter brought their knees to their chest and muttered to themselves that, in their defense, they had tried to warn him.

"I don&rsquo;t know who any of these people are, but&hellip;" Claire whispered to them. "Is there&hellip; even <i>more</i> than this?"
The entity sent her a deadpan look. "I hardly think that right now&rsquo;s a good time. But if you <i>have</i> to know, I could make a list."

When they are alone, Clay will try to see by any means if they could possibly find a way to give themselves their own body&hellip; And their eyes will fall on the black case. Curious, they will open it, reveal that it contains a 3DS as well as six cartridges, and they will insert &ldquo;the blue one.&rdquo; They will boot up London Life&hellip; And see that all saves were blank. No matter, they could just as well create a new character from scratch.

<p style=Prof. Layton><d>First, you&rsquo;ll need to create your<br>character to get started on your new life.</d></p>
<p>They snorted. That sounded about right.</p>
<i>You could say that again</i>, they almost said out loud.

Copying a pile of pixels was far more complicated than copying a real live person; but they found respite in the idea that, at least, this left the image with more than enough freedom for them to simply imagine their own missing details.
They closed their eyes. Took a deep breath. Stood up from the couch and walked to a mirror&hellip;
The person staring back at them was unrecognizeable. It did fit their expectations, it did come from the pile of pixels that they had taken as inspiration, and it did look nothing like any of the people they had previously met, or expected to ever meet in the future; but&hellip; It simply didn&rsquo;t feel like &ldquo;them&ldquo;, either.
Still. Being a &ldquo;nobody&ldquo; definitely was an improvement compared to being &ldquo;someone else.&ldquo;

(Layton arrives, startling them. They turn around, mutter &ldquo;&hellip;Professor.&ldquo;, once again making Layton cringe a bit. The surprise was enough for their disguise to partially decompose, their hair changing color and a top hat suddenly raising from thin air. Sighing, they squinted up at the new addition, carefully removed it from their head, and held it against their chest.)
Layton gave them a deep, empathizing look, keeping his silence. As he was about to turn back, saying that he would give them some space, he noticed the strange device laying on the couch. As the shape-shifter followed his eyes and found that they had stupidly left everything blatantly open for everyone to see, they rushed to it and crammed the spread out cartridges back into the case (<i>they had his name written on them, they had to go first</i>), before seizing the console and closing it. Embarrassment flustered all over their face when they turned to look sheepishly at the professor, who, if anything, seemed slightly amused.

&ldquo;I did not see anything, don&rsquo;t worry.&ldquo; he assured. &ldquo;I apologize if this was something private to you.&ldquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; not your fault. I&rsquo;m the one who wasn&rsquo;t cautious enough.&ldquo;


&ldquo;You will find it someday.&ldquo; he eventually muttered in a somewhat reassuring tone.
They stared down at the hat. &ldquo;Find what?&ldquo;
He repressed a short laugh. &ldquo;Yourself, I suppose. In more ways than one.&ldquo;

<!-- Timeline:
Claire brings Clay to Layton, they say that they knew Layton from the future and was part of his team (forced to say it when Layton mused how many details they seemed to know about him personally).
Clay talks about Desmond Sycamore and how his family could get killed anytime between &ldquo;years ago&ldquo; and &ldquo;in a few years.&ldquo;

Layton says that the name &ldquo;Sycamore&ldquo; slightly rings a bell, but that he needs more info so as to know where to find him. He goes to ask Schrader, who can indeed give him Desmond&rsquo;s university.
Claire offers to go to a café with a view on the entrance of Desmond&rsquo;s uni, and wait there until they see Desmond come out. They talk a bit, and when Desmond does indeed walk out, Clay is ready to stand up and go meet him-- but Layton stops them. He shows them that a suspicious man with sunglasses who had up until then been standing immobile, pretending to read the newspaper, was now following Desmond. Layton confirms that Clay&rsquo;s fears were actually justified and that they need to find a way to rid Desmond of these stalkers, whi are, according to Clay&rsquo;s intel, most definitely Targent agents.

Layton asks Claire to pay the bill and bring Clay home safely, making sure not to follow them, and Claire agrees immediately. Clay is frustrated to be left aside as Layton goes alone, but Claire warns him that it is a matter of stealth, and that being three instead of one would actually play against them in this situation. Also, she trusts Hershel and knows that he will be careful and go home alright.

Layton is here for dinner, and has some semblance of a plan; but before they enact it, Layton wants Clay to be completely honest. Clay is thus forced to talk about the videogame.
Did the shape-shifter&rsquo;s appearance have anything to do with Bill activating the time machine? Maybe, maybe not. I have no idea and it heavily depends on whether it&rsquo;s conceivable for a time machine to cause weird shenanigans while it isn&rsquo;t even supposed to activate yet, which means that the answer is probably &ldquo;no, or else the machine would have likely exploded.&ldquo;
If I ever post this thing publicly (which is highly debatable), I think I&rsquo;ll stop the prologue at the moment when the lab scene stops and Claire offers to see if Layton can help solve the mystery of OC-chan&rsquo;s pretty much everything. And then put an end note saying &ldquo;hey if you&rsquo;re here to try and solve the entirety of the mystery of OC-chan, you&rsquo;ll find yourself in another Sherl situation. The short answer to the question &ldquo;How and why did OC-chan appear at this exact time and place?&ldquo; is &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask&ldquo;, the long answer is &ldquo;Maybe someday I&rsquo;ll find something, but don&rsquo;t count on it. This is a fix fic, not a &rsquo;look at my OC&rsquo; fic.&ldquo;
If you&rsquo;re here to stay, be ready, because many people are going to Not die very soon.&ldquo;
Be warned, people will be overwhelmed with much, much relief and happiness, and there will be a lot of tears (of joy).

&ldquo;So uh, just by showing up there, I kinda sorta accidentally saved Claire from certain death, and since the time machine didn&rsquo;t explode then the nearby buildings were also spared, which means that we shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about a vengeful orphan creating an entire futuristic London replica and eventually trying to destroy the real London in order to prove a point against corruption or something, and Dimitri also won&rsquo;t join him in his evil plan because since Claire&rsquo;s alive he has no reason to want to go back in time to save her&hellip; Oh, and I guess I also probably interfered with politics in some way, because I may or may not have stopped Bill from becoming Prime Minister too?&ldquo;
They felt the need to add:
&ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m complaining, all of those are GREAT improvements. Probably. Not completely sure about the politics thing, for all we know Bill&rsquo;s opponents wouldn&rsquo;t make good Prime Ministers either.&ldquo; &ldquo;&hellip; Was Bill even bad as a Prime Minister? I&rsquo;m not sure about the standards.&ldquo;
[&hellip;]
&ldquo;I literally did nothing by myself on purpose, but&hellip;&ldquo; They pursed their lips, still staring at the floor. Their gaze went back up, and they shrugged in the most undecisive way possible. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome?&ldquo;

Claire&rsquo;s mouth was still ready to eat flies, and Hershel looked like he could fall over any second.



&ldquo;All in all, I just actively saved one person&rsquo;s life, which also leads to saving the lives of a dozen more bystanders too, and in the long run we&rsquo;ve practically erased from reality a tragedy that would have happened ten years from now.&ldquo;

Everyone mused on these words, each weighing the parts of this sentence and all its implications.
After about three seconds and a half of active thinking, the shapeshifter raised a head to look back at the couple, and shone a devil grin that (thankfully not literally) sliced their face in half.

&ldquo;I say we do it again.&ldquo;

*** (end of chapter 2, probably)


&ldquo;I-- It&rsquo;s been barely a week! How can anyone call me a &rsquo;professor&rsquo; just yet&hellip;?&ldquo;
&ldquo;No, no! By all means, keep calling him that.&ldquo; Claire laughed, smirking sassily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll need to get used to it eventually, so we might as well get started. Isn&rsquo;t that right, Professor?&ldquo;
&ldquo;Agh--! Not you too&hellip;&ldquo;-->
