<div class=chctn><div class=ch><article><h1>Prologue<hr></h1><p class=em>There were many reasons behind Bill Hawks&rsquo;s presence on this precise day, at this precise hour, about to change History in what could possibly be the most literal sense possible.</p>
<p>For the first, and perhaps the last time in his life, the scientist could experience this ever so rare sense of nausea that comes neither from sickness nor from anticipation per se, but rather from the realization of how crucial the next few moments would be; from the sheer weight of the power he had in his hands; from the intoxicating knowledge that in this very moment, he was the one in control of not just his own destiny, but that of many others.</p>
<p>There were, once again, many reasons for him to be here and then. Progress was one of them; the one he wished to keep upfront, and the only one he wished others to see. Ambition was another; the one he would try to justify as a good reason, as long as it remained the means to an end, rather than an end all by itself. And then, greed&hellip; The one he pretended did not exist.</p>
<hr class=bar><hr class=clock>
<p>Claire gave him one last glance, then entered their experimental time machine. He turned back to the controls, approaching his hand to one of the many levers, his hesitation only caused by, once again, this exhilarating feeling of responsibility that would turn his entire self into a heavy mass of cold, dripping lead.</p>
<p>One movement, and the doors would close; one movement, and the assistant would be shut away from the entire world; one movement, and she would be sent beyond the limits of their present. Ready to be the first time traveler in existence.</p>
<p>Bill took one last inspiration&hellip; then, having waited for long enough, he sprang into action.</p>
<p>The lever was pulled.<br>The doors were closed.<br>Something opened.</p>
<p>It was brief, transient, and blinding. Just <i>what</i> was it that opened in this moment would be nearly impossible to tell; however, &ldquo;what was it&rdquo; that came out of it soon revealed itself, and with it came a blast powerful enough to entirely blow away the very same doors that Bill had been so adamant on closing in the first place.</p>
<p>Just as shocked as him, Claire turned around to stare at the gaping hole that rendered the time machine most certainly improper for use. Completely dumbfounded, the head scientist, who still had his hand resting on the lever, uselessly raised it back to its original position, just as the rest of his body had completely turned into a lifeless statue and blood was drained from his crumpled face.<br>There was no door to reopen, but the hinges let him know that they tried their best nonetheless, as an agonizing creaking noise resonated in response.</p>
<p>Claire cautiously walked out of the machine, stepping over both the broken doors and whatever had come out of <i>whatever this place &mdash;if it even was a place to begin with&mdash; was</i>, careful not to wake it. What could this possibly be&hellip; a person?</p>
<p>Unmoving at first, the form granted the astounded duo a few long seconds to admire it; and once the shock washed away, both realized that &ldquo;it&rdquo;, in fact, did look an awful lot like a person. Given the extraordinary circumstances of its appearance, as well as the painful posture in which it had landed, limbs sprawled all over and face embracing a quite touching reunion with the floor, Claire tried to tell herself that it was a reasonable behavior to not at all think right away about the possibility that the thing could actually be a regular, normal, perfectly average human being.</p>
<p>Still, despite their high intellect and reasoning skills, the initial shock caused by this unexplainable phenomenon was such that this realization had to come in two steps. The first step had been reached once they had acknowledged that it was a human being; the second step was reached when Claire realized that it was a human being, yes, but also that this human being was currently lying face first, unconscious, on hard concrete, in a position that was <i>very much not</i> what a physiotherapist (or any normal person with an iota of common sense, for that matter) would recommend.</p>
<p>Were they&hellip; Was that person still alive at all? One thing was for certain, just standing there and watching in silence was only going to diminish their chances of survival. Claire gulped, but resolutely kneeled down to try and gently approach a comforting hand&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;But the moment her fingers came in contact with the unknown person&rsquo;s shoulder, she reeled back and cried in both surprise and pain, as a sudden shock traversed her. It seemed to have been mutual, as the person chose this exact moment to spring to life and share a pained mumble of their own, as they tried to gather their limbs and rise to their knees.<br>Had it been static electricity, perhaps? Hopefully it was only that&mdash;</p>
<p>Claire locked eyes with the stranger, and she screamed.</p>
<p>When she had seen the person rise from the ground without assistance, as if, against what their initial position strongly implied, none of their bones had actually been broken in the first place, the&nbsp;young scientist had subconsciously acknowledged that something was very, very wrong; but this observation was soon forgotten just a few seconds later, brushed aside by the far more unnerving sight that followed.</p>
<p>Eye to eye, in perfect silence, Claire was staring at an astonishingly accurate recreation of her own face.</p>
<p>It was only when he saw the mysterious intruder move that Bill took his first step forward. When he found himself face to face with not one, but <i>two</i> Claires, he was understandably overcome by shock; but, contrary to his assistant, this shock quickly let place to a delirious grin.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Incredible&hellip; Could it really be&hellip;?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>This question, alongside all of Bill&rsquo;s deductions and hopes, were thrown out the window when he saw the second Claire turn to look at him in utter silence and somehow <i>melt</i> to reshape itself into a nearly perfect copy of himself.<br>No. That was not time travel. That <i>thing</i> was <i>absolutely not</i> a hypothetical alter-ego of Claire who would have come from a near future thanks to his machine.</p>
<p>Claire had coincidentally read a certain science fiction horror story not too long ago; a certain story about scientists who came across some alien creature capable of imitating other lifeforms and whose only purpose was to reproduce and replace. Needless to say, she was trying hard not to panic or jump to conclusions &mdash;there <i>had</i> to be some rational explanation, there just had to be&hellip; But still, just in case, her eyes would carefully glance around when she dared look away from <i>that</i>, searching for any means to perhaps create a controlled, sanitizing fire, if the need came to be.</p>
<p>The head researcher opened his mouth, just about to blabber some terrified words; but he was not given this chance.</p>
<p>The door to their office crashed open, as a thin panting man in a crumpled lab coat barged in at full force. Completely exhausted, but still determined to get his point across, he hardly took the time to breathe and instead shouted instantly, as distinctly as he could:</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Bill! Claire! We cannot&hellip;!&rdquo; There was some coughing. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t, proceed, with the experiment&hellip; We made a grave mistake!&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The two scientists in question turned to face the newcomer in great surprise. Claire soon turned her gaze back to the entity beside her, who had gone back to impersonating her instead of her colleague; Bill wanted to do the same, but he was, once again, not granted this chance, when the very same panting man who had interrupted him the first time dared to interrupt him again, as he threw a mess of papers and equations into his hands and started blabbering the details of just how important that mistake was and how it could lead to disaster if left unchecked.<br>The hysteric scientist called for the woman to come to him too, and despite her fear of letting the <i>whatever it was</i> unchecked, she was soon absorbed by the conversation nonetheless when she started hearing that she and the entire neighborhood had just barely escaped a gruesome death.</p>
<hr class=bar><hr class=clock>
<p>And so, the entity had been indeed left unchecked; fortunately for the forgetful scientists, it made no effort to move, instead still staring at the group, as if in a trance. After hearing a few words, it too was absorbed in many thoughts, about an explosion that could have occurred, about deaths that had been prevented, about a man who had just made it in time to stop a careless colleague who was about to cause a tragedy on a massive scale, one far more terrifying than any of the three could imagine in this moment&hellip; the entity completely lost track of its surroundings.</p>
<p>As it felt somewhat faint and bent down if ever so slightly, it came to stare at the floor instead&mdash; and it finally noticed that something was by its side. Something that was not a broken mechanical door, and something that did not seem to belong in this place.</p>
<p>It was a simple black pouch, rectangular and rather flat, just above the size of an adult human&rsquo;s hand. Intrigued, the entity picked it up, slid the zipper, and opened it&hellip; only to instantly widen a pair of eyes and raise a silent gasp.<br>The pouch was instantly closed (with such force in fact, that despite it being made of a light and relatively soft material, a slight echo of this gesture&rsquo;s sound bounced a few times); the zipper was slid to its entire end; and the precious item was shoved against the entity&rsquo;s chest, soon surrounded by a pair of arms.<br>Many emotions could be reflected in the entity&rsquo;s gaze: confusion, terror, bewilderment&hellip; But the distracted scientists did not get to see any of it.</p>
<hr class=bar><hr class=clock>
<p>Distracted, however, they did not remain for that much longer.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;&hellip;Wait, I just noticed. Who is this?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Dimitri blinked in confusion, a shiver running down his spine when he recognized and compared the face of the stranger with the one of the woman standing next to him. This question having been uttered louder than the others, this caught the attention of the person involved, who raised a head and locked eyes with him.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Could we address why there&rsquo;s another&mdash;&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>His sentence was abruptly cut short by a scream when he saw the face of the second Claire melt down and instantly morph into an imitation of his own.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I suppose this answers at least part of your question.&rdquo; Claire replied gravely. Her words held her usual amount of faint mischievousness, but this time, none of it was shared by her tone. &ldquo;This is definitely not me.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Hearing these words, the silent shape-shifting entity turned the copy of Dimitri&rsquo;s head back towards her, but the gaze was lost and unfocused. The moment it locked eyes with Claire, once again the face transformed to reflect hers to near-perfection.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that thing is, but it&rsquo;s not human.&rdquo; Bill muttered, once again paralyzed by terror now that he was no longer distracted by the topic of the cancelled experiment.</d></p>
<p>It looked like the non-human in question had just been struck by lightning. Finally, something seemed to click. The entity lowered its head and weakly raised a hand, still keeping the black pouch in the other, and stared at it in confusion and what could have been interpreted as some form of denial&hellip; and they transformed again.</p><p>Dimitri. Claire. Dimitri. Claire. Bill showed up as well, but only once.</p>
<p>The entity opened a mouth, closed it, opened it again, but the shock seemed to have stolen its voice. Its entire body started shaking in panic, as it clutched the small black pouch against its chest and started hyperventilating.</p>
<p>The thing was having a panic attack, or at least was incredibly convincing in faking one. It morphed again, and again, changing shape with the same speed and fluidity as a chameleon would change color, taking new faces, some of which belonging to people who had never set foot in this office. The changes were sometimes too quick to register, but some would repeatedly appear: a man in a top hat, a teenage girl in a pretty orange dress, a young boy with a blue cap, a fierce lady with puffy hair and a yellow suit&hellip;<br>The shifting dance of horror never stopped, and even the one instigating it seemed powerless to stop it. The breathing became faster and heavier, the shaking became more frantic, and finally, a fourth scream emerged.</p>
<p>The ever shifting entity raised its gaze to the three scientists, staring at them one by one, terror in the eyes&mdash; and a single word managed to escape.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;&hellip;Sorry&hellip;!&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Bill jumped three feet in the air, going from horror and disgust to the most absolute, rawest fear at its most fundamental level.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;It can <i>talk</i>!?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The thing cowered.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;That&mdash; that&rsquo;s not&mdash;&rdquo; It sounded like it was chocking on thin air, shocked by its own ever changing voice, which at no point sounded like one it believed to be its own. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing it on purpose, I swear!&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>It was quite a nice way to clearly summarize what had now become a very well established fact, Claire reasoned.<br>The being stared at its ever changing body, terrified itself.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I need h-help&hellip; Make it stop. Please make it stop!&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Claire clenched her hands into shaking, but determined fists, having taken her decision. Against the odds, and moreso against the better judgement of her two colleagues, she carefully took a few steps towards the unknown being, and crouched down to their level.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;We can see that you&rsquo;re scared too, at least as much as we are. Perhaps, if you can&hellip;&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Her sentence trailed off, as she tried to find better words. Her lips trembled for a few more seconds.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Maybe, we should all, take a deep breath, and calm down.&rdquo; she rephrased, turning towards the scientists in her back and giving them a deep look. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem like you would hurt us, and we do not want to hurt you either. We&rsquo;re just confused. So&hellip; Let&rsquo;s all just take some time to take this all in, alright? Surely, you would have better control over it if you can think clearly.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>They merely looked at her; though the transformations did not stop, they did seem to gradually slow down and become more stable. Soon, they managed to reach a single form&mdash; but once they realized that it was the one of the very same person who was trying to help, they shook their (Claire&rsquo;s) head forcefully and grabbed it, and the transformations resumed once again, forcing the assistant to reel back a bit.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&hellip; can&rsquo;t remember&mdash; I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The woman looked at them in pity. Could it be that they did not actually have a shape of their own? Or, more likely given these last words, that they had found themselves incapable of settling on it.<br>Claire bit her lip, hesitated&hellip; but quickly murmured to them in a reassuring tone.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Just focus on me for the time being. Can you do that?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The shape-shifter looked at her with great fear, but soon morphed again to match her appearance, creating a perfect copy. They were still shaking, their skin acting somewhat similar to water just about to boil and burst; but having been granted the permission to keep this shape seemed to help them stabilize its form.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;You&hellip; You don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>This all but confirmed that at the very least <i>one</i> of the main reasons behind their distress was the guilt of borrowing others&rsquo; identities, and understandably terrorizing them in the process. Once again, Claire paused to ponder her words carefully.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I would be lying if I said that I don&rsquo;t mind it,&rdquo; she corrected, &ldquo;but I believe that I would be the one most ready to somewhat accept it. I was meant to travel to a different time, so&hellip; I had prepared myself mentally for the prospect of possibly meeting myself.&rdquo; She took a deep breath, closing her eyes resolutely. &ldquo;This is not at all the same, but I suppose that I can live with this until we find a better solution.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The entity looked away in shame, but she cupped their chin &mdash;her own chin, oh stars, that was truly disconcerting&mdash; and turned their face back to her.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll figure it out together. All of us.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The young woman slowly stood up and turned towards her colleagues, sending them what now was a reassuring, somewhat confident smile, but accompanied with a commanding look.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s jaw dropped. Dimitri took a step back and his eyes darted away, as he started looking for the right words.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; He closed his mouth. Hesitated. But he soon somewhat regained his composure, and took a deep breath. &ldquo;&hellip;I trust your judgement, Claire.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>He had replied with a heavy sigh and seemed at first simply resigned, but it could still be heard that his words were genuine.<br>Slowly and carefully approaching, Dimitri brought a hand to his chin. This exchange with Claire seemed to have convinced him that, at the very least, there was no immediate threat; and thus, both his sympathy and his curiosity resurfaced.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;It seems that you will take on the appearance of whoever you are thinking about at any given time&hellip;&rdquo; he uttered, believing that trying to rationalize the situation would give everyone some respite from the chaos of the fear that had clouded their minds for far too long. &ldquo;Whether it be the first person that comes to mind, or&mdash;&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Cutting off his own sentence, he closed his eyes, bit his lip, pinched the bridge of his nose, and inhaled loudly.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Well, apparently you <i>can</i> think of multiple people at once, and by all means possible, I sincerely wish it weren&rsquo;t the case.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The shape-shifter realized that they had once again transformed without realizing it, this time only partially so. After trying to mend their mistake, they buried a head that still did not belong to them, within a pair of arms that also did not belong to them, no matter what shape they took. Claire sent her colleague a disapproving glare which perfectly conveyed the words <i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not helping.&rdquo;</i>, and in return his shoulders slumped down with instant regret.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I&hellip; suppose I <i>am</i> quite curious about this situation, so I wouldn&rsquo;t mind assisting in the investigation, if there can be one to begin with&mdash; I will admit that I don&rsquo;t even know where we could get started. But&hellip;&rdquo; He directed his eyes towards the shape-shifter. &ldquo;Please. Promise me that you won&rsquo;t turn into me again. It&rsquo;s incredibly disturbing.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;&hellip;I can promise that I will <i>try</i>.&rdquo; the being in question corrected with blunt honesty, as the color of a single strand of hair changed from Claire&rsquo;s ginger to a subtly purplish grey.</d></p>
<p>Their (Claire&rsquo;s) eyes looked up and squinted at it; they pursed their lips; the strand of hair instantly turned back to ginger; they sent the man a sheepish, strained grin.<br>Dimitri buried his head in one hand, rubbing his forehead, sighing heavily for the he-did-not-care-to-count&rsquo;th time, and muttering something that sounded like an exhausted &ldquo;Close enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Claire turned towards the one person who had remained in the back and not uttered a single word in the last few minutes.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;What about you, Bill? Will you help?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The head scientist stared at her with a gaping jaw and a pair of eyes ready to pop out like balloons. Unmoving, he came from looking at her, to looking at the ever-changing duplicate, to looking at the one man he thought he could count on to bring back a speck of common sense, back and forth&hellip;<br>And eventually, he just shook his head in disbelief, threw his hands in the air, and his feet performed a perfectly smooth rotation of a hundred and eighty degrees. The message was clear: how dare she even entertain the idea that he would ever want to get involved.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I give up. This is insanity.&rdquo;, said he as he sternly walked out of the office and slammed the door behind him.</d></p>
<p>Claire and Dimitri simply stared at the closed door for a moment. They both looked disappointed, but in some way, also not surprised in the slightest.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind him.&rdquo; the woman sighed exasperatedly. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;And even if he did, I frankly doubt that anyone would believe him.&rdquo; Dimitri pointed out.</d></p>
<p>The woman stiffled a short laugh, nodding in approval.<br>She stood up, offering a hand to her double, and&hellip;</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Oh my, I&rsquo;m terribly sorry!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as a wave of embarrassment overcame her. &ldquo;We should have started there first. Do you have a name?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The fake Claire froze. Looked away. Clutched the small black pouch against their chest. Then finally admitted in an empty voice:</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&hellip; remember it.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>There was a heavy silence.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on&mdash; I just know that I wasn&rsquo;t&hellip; I wasn&rsquo;t always like this. I was normal before, I&rsquo;m&mdash; I just <i>had</i> to be. But I can&rsquo;t remember anything about my life&mdash; I don&rsquo;t know who I am, or was, or&hellip; Heck, now I don&rsquo;t even know <i>what</i> I am.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Claire and Dimitri shared a concerned, sympathizing look.<br>An amnesiac human who no longer felt like one, forced to wear the faces of others, incapable of remembering their own&hellip; One would have to be heartless to not at the very least feel for them and their tragedy. How would they even be able to search for their past if they did not even have a face or a name as a starting clue?</p>
<p>Somewhat hopeful, the entity turned towards the woman and looked at her intensely.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Did I&hellip;&rdquo; They gulped tensely. &ldquo;Did you get to see what I looked like <i>before</i> I started&ndash;&rdquo; (They gestured their entire self.) &ldquo;&ndash;all this?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>Claire looked down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. You were facing the ground, and your head was covered&hellip;&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>She blinked. Now that she was thinking about it, she certainly was now curious to know how they could mimic not only people, but perfectly replicate their clothing as well. Everything that they had worn before waking up and first laying eyes on her&mdash; it was gone. The only thing that remained unchanged&hellip; was this tiny, mysterious pouch that they were keeping against their chest as if their life depended on it.</p>
<p>The shape-shifter&rsquo;s shoulders slumped down, but they nodded slowly in understanding. They looked away, muttering a half-hearted and bittersweet &ldquo;Thanks anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose hope. I said we would help, and I will not go back on my word.&rdquo; Claire reassured, putting her hands on her hips confidently. Her face suddenly lit up with a joyful smile: &ldquo;In fact, I&rsquo;d like to introduce you to a certain someone I know, and who would certainly be delighted to have such a fascinating mystery to solve.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>The entity blinked, their interest piqued. They remained silent for a half second, but soon asked, a strong emotion in their eyes: &ldquo;Ah&hellip; And who would that be?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Her lips tight and her stature unmoving, Claire inhaled sharply. Dimitri&rsquo;s face fell completely.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I believe you already know.&rdquo; she soon muttered with cold and calculating reason. &ldquo;After all, out of all the faces you borrowed when you were panicking, his was the one you came to the most.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Once again, Dimitri was now burying his head in his hands and taking deep breaths. Claire ignored him, but a reaction of her own was that of disappointment and a very slight amount of annoyance.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;&hellip; It&rsquo;s no use pretending that my deduction was by any means impressive, because you are now making it painfully obvious. It was quite fleeting the first time I noticed it, but now you are not even trying to hide it. From the very moment I alluded to him and up till now, it is <i>literally</i> written all over your face &mdash; well, <i>his</i> face &mdash; that you know who I&rsquo;m talking about.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Once again, this news shocked the shape-shifter to no end, as they brought a hand to brush their cheek and indeed came to the realization that it was not the one they were meant to wear. And once again, after this fleeting split second of realization instantly came another wave of utter chaos as they tried, and seemingly failed, to revert their appearance to the one they had agreed upon.<br>When they paused and took a deep but panicked breath, Claire was still facing the imitation of her boyfriend. In fact, if anything, the imitation had only become all the more indubitably refined and accurate.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;By the way, you will have to explain how you knew about the hat. I gave it to him less than an hour ago, so I&rsquo;m quite eager to learn how it could have possibly crossed your mind &mdash; and ended up on your head.&rdquo;</d></p>
