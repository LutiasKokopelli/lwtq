Dimitri will manage to hack into the cartridge and copy all its files (so he can make sure not to damage it more than necessary).
This was the tiniest floppy disk he had ever seen. And yet, the amount of data it contained was far more than any of them.
Dimitri has a lot of trouble extracting the data from the cartridge and decrypting it; so when he finally manages to obtain a list of files, he will look carefully at the extensions. And after finding a video, he will decide to only look at those first.

He mainly gets to see that:
    - Claire was supposed to die
    - Dimitri never moved on from her death
    - The blue jacket outfit that the entity had copied... The entity had, indeed, seen it from somewhere else, it seemed.
    - In fact, many of the appearances that the entity had taken, specifically during their moments of panic, were ones he could see in these files.

Cutscenes he gets to see, in order:     https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1C5206641CD4700C

    - Cinematic 28: Layton and Luke enter the car, Claire goes to him and tries to go with him but he refuses.
            -> Dimitri recognizes Claire's outfit, as well as the fake name "Celeste"
            -> He is also highly confused as to what's going on. There's a gigantic monstruous machine destroying everything with missiles, and Layton somehow manages to climb it with a car. (Later, he might think of it as his own plan, though he cannot fathom why)

    - Cinematic 33? Claire does something badass by jumping off a flying car and saving Clive.

    - Cinematic 2: "It all started about a week ago..."
            -> Layton?? and wait this voice-- IS THAT HIM? And... Bill looks annoyed.
    - Cinematic 7???
            -> Gets to see the "Celeste" outfit that the entity had allegedly "seen somewhere else"
            -> Notices that Hershel looks incredibly shocked to see her.
    - Cinematic 17?
            -> Dimitri gets to see himself act like a true villain, as well as holding BILL HOSTAGE?

    - LAST ONE: Cinematic 24. After watching this one, he will take a long break.
            Dimitri's voice over: "By the time I realized that Bill planned to go ahead with the experiment, it was too late to stop him."
            -> Dimitri sees an alternate version of today's events... and witnesses Claire's death.


This makes him wonder if he could, somehow, have been the one responsible for sending the entity there in the first place; meaning that his future's plan would have worked.

He will be scared by the hypothesis he would make. His hypothesis: the entity came from the future alongside the cartridge, with the express intent of stopping the explosion; and, objectively speaking, this had been a success.

But the entity itself... Since they claimed that they used to be human, but also had forgotten all about themselves; but since they had been sent here, with data about the long-lasting consequences of an explosion that they had prevented... Was the entity Dimitri himself?
