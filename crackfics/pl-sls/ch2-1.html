<p class=em>Inviting someone to come and visit a good friend is a completely classic, trivial, quite pleasant and healthy activity; on top of being, in principle and colloquially speaking, a walk in the park.</p><v></v><p>Now, bringing someone who had the unfortunate tendency to change their appearance with as much ease and uncontrolled regularity as one would breathe, from an academic laboratory in the heart of Bloomsbury, the student centre of London, to a small apartment on the other side of the Thames, which was admittedly located in the same city, but still required a bus trip and a good twenty-minute journey to reach, and all this without alerting or terrorizing anyone on the way&hellip; This brought a whole package of subtleties and intricacies to what should have otherwise been an easy and forgettable task.</p><v></v><p>Dimitri had been staring at the heart of the problem for quite some time now, deep in thought, trying as best he could to find an efficient way to avoid ending up in either an asylum, or a prison, or a combination of the two that could possibly be even worse.</p><v></v><p><d>&ldquo;It seems&hellip; <i>relatively</i> easier for you to keep Claire&rsquo;s appearance,&rdquo; he had quickly noticed, albeit with very little confidence in his words.</d></p><v></v>
<p>It had been about fifteen minutes since Bill had left them, and the remaining physicist found himself in quite the pickle. &lsquo;Relatively&rsquo; was not a word too many, because despite their best efforts, the slightest distraction was enough for their new friend to jump from one identity to another, or to at the very least adopt minor, but still clearly noticeable changes to their form. The only solution that seemed to present itself to them at the time was to simply limit the aforementioned distractions; but how could this be done during a trip, when the mere fact of seeing two strictly identical women side by side was destined to attract at least a few curious stares from bystanders?</p>
<p>The idea of having Hershel Layton come to the mystery, rather than bringing the mystery to Hershel Layton, had been raised; but Claire had been quick to point out that Gressenheller, despite being a wonderful campus, was not meant to be a long-term place to live in. Of course, she was not going to impose on her boyfriend to accommodate the newcomer without having talked to him about it beforehand; but since they would eventually need to take them to an apartment, whether it was his, hers, or someone else&rsquo;s, then the problem of the journey would arise just as much, since she herself did not live too far from the destination they currently had in mind, and that she would gladly welcome the stranger if Hershel could not&mdash;an outcome she expected to meet.</p><v></v>
<p>And so, they were back to their original issue: helping this dear amnesiac stranger keep their newly acquired peculiarity under control. Among the rare good news they had, Dimitri&rsquo;s remark was correct: it was true that Claire&rsquo;s form was by far the most stable, and therefore the one that would most certainly have to do for the moment. If these transformations were related to the affect that the entity had for the imitated person, then this was easily explained: not only was the original present by their side, but she was also the only person who had expressly given her permission to be used as a model. Moreover&hellip; Certainly, her optimism, her courage, her intrepid but mature malice, had quickly won the little being&rsquo;s heart and trust.</p><p>If behind these changing appearances was truly hiding the spirit of a child, then perhaps one could even see somewhere in there some hazardous psychological hypotheses, highlighting a certain desire to identify with a role model; a normal behaviour that was expected out of young children&hellip; but which took on a much more literal turn in this current situation.</p><v></v>
<p><d>‚ÄúI could always pretend that I have a twin sister,‚Äù Claire smiled mischievously. ‚ÄúAs for a name, if anyone asks, let‚Äôs say‚Ä¶‚Äù</d></p><v></v>
<p><d>‚ÄúCeleste?‚Äù they blurted out instantly, probably not realising that the word had been uttered out loud, rather than simply having come to and remained within their mind.</d></p><v></v><p>Closing her mouth suddenly, the red-haired scientist showed a startled expression and blinked, visibly taken aback. After a split second of silence, she raised a pair of puzzled, almost suspicious eyebrows, and crossed her arms. Tilting her head slightly to one side, she forced herself to smile again.</p><v></v>
<p><d>‚Äú‚Ä¶Yes. ‚ÄòCeleste.‚Äô Why not,‚Äù she finally agreed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ funny that you would say that. I was thinking the exact same thing! Say, you wouldn‚Äôt happen to also read minds while you‚Äôre at it, would you?‚Äù</d></p><v></v>
<p><i>That could explain the hat</i>, she didn&rsquo;t add.</p><v></v>
<p>Obviously, a horror novel was far from being a reliable, scientifically based reference, and the young woman reminded herself of this fact each time its story, with its tragic ending and its fictional creature, which was described as indeed evil, would come to her mind; but the fact that said fictional creature was indeed able to read the minds of its victims did not help her discard this source of clues for good. To this, could also be added the memory she had of the exact moment when the entity had woken up: it had only happened when she had lightly brushed their shoulder, and had received a strong electric shock in return. She was still convinced that only static electricity was to blame, and that there was nothing more to it‚Ä¶ but she refused just as much to ignore hypotheses which, albeit extremely improbable, had not yet been refuted with absolute certainty.</p><p>Telepathy was an absurd idea to conceive‚Ä¶ But the idea of a being able to change its appearance at will in just a few seconds, and who even seemed to laugh at the laws of conservation of matter at the same time, was just as ludicrous, if not more.</p><v></v>
<p><d>‚ÄúHm‚Ä¶ But even twin sisters aren‚Äôt completely identical, right?‚Äù</d></p><v></v><p>Their attempt to change the subject had not even tried to be discreet or subtle, which further emphasised their embarrassment at the idea of answering the scientist‚Äôs question. Claire had her reservations and did not conclude that she had unexpectedly hit the mark, but she still added this reaction to the increasingly long list of hints that she had already filled within the past half hour.</p><v></v>
<p>At this moment, the child was copying Claire‚Äôs appearance with such a high level of perfection, that the only clue Dimitri had to differentiate them was, besides their behaviour, the small black pouch that only the impostor carried in their arms. And yet, said impostor closed their eyes and took a deep, focused breath: a sign that the two adults had quickly learned to recognise as a signal that their form was about to change once more. Dimitri preferred to look away in silence and wait for it to be over, refusing to take the risk of distracting them once again in the midst of the process, and of subjecting his eyes to yet another accidental sight of horror that his brain would later take an evil pleasure to replay during his future nightmares.</p><p>The reproduction of Claire‚Äôs face did not change, but among the list of alterations that took place, here are some of the most notable: the glasses disappeared, the hair came to be tied in a loose and low ponytail, while the clothes changed completely, now displaying a blue jacket surrounding a white t-shirt and a small pink scarf, as well as dark green pants. With one last breath, a white hat with an apple-green ribbon appeared out of nowhere, and it was immediately placed on their head, as a conclusion to the performance.</p><p>This hat had most certainly been added so that the entity could have something to protect themselves from everyone‚Äôs gaze, and to hide their flustered and shy expression.</p><v></v><p><d>‚ÄúSo, uh‚Ä¶ How‚Äôs that?‚Äù</d></p><v></v>
<p>This timid mumble alerted the two adults that it was now safe for them to turn around; and as soon as they laid eyes upon this new disguise, they needed several long seconds to recover from their surprise.</p><p>As always, the final result was impressive; but the detail that always attracted the scientists‚Äô attention a little more was the appearance and disappearance of accessories, especially elements composed of an inorganic material, such as a hat or glasses, which at first glance seemed to come out of nowhere. Claire had been close enough to see that the truth was far from it, or at the very least, that matter did not actually materialise out of thin air, or disappear in the blink of an eye‚Äîbut the alternative was just as intriguing, and much more unpleasant to observe.</p><p>Imagining that objects could be created from nothing and destroyed without a trace, was disturbing in regards to the most fundamental laws of physics. Imagining that these objects were instead created from the very same flesh of the person who was going to wear them, was disturbing in regards to the rules of propriety, and to the sanity of any human being who was unfortunate enough to witness a pair of glasses whose mount blended into a copy of her own cheekbones, and a hat whose mesh was woven directly from the fibres of the hand that was about to hold it. In short: whether the entity was innocent and benevolent as they had proven to be so far, or bloodthirsty and demonic like in the horror novels‚Ä¶ In either case, it was just as necessary to have a strong enough stomach to handle the sight.</p><v></v>
<p>Now that the result was there, and that the unstable and nightmarish state of transition had finally ended, the young red-haired woman realised that, while seeing a carbon copy of oneself moving on its own was already a disturbing experience, it was actually even stranger to see said carbon copy in an outfit she had never worn before. She still had to admit that the outfit in question was elegant, and very much in her style; it would not have been so surprising for her to imagine wearing it one day, if the opportunity had presented itself.</p><p>The silence lasted for a long while, Claire having needed more time than usual to recover from the shock. And so, it was Dimitri who broke it first:</p><v></v><p><d>‚ÄúThis is incredible,‚Äù he uttered sincerely and breathlessly. ‚ÄúDid you just imagine this from nothing?‚Äù</d></p><v></v><p><d>‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôve‚Ä¶ seen it before,‚Äù they replied in a small and sheepish voice, lowering the hat even further over their eyes. ‚ÄúI just thought it would fit.‚Äù</d></p><v></v>
<p>Claire was once again surprised by this behaviour, but this helped pull her from her previous thoughts. She took a moment to look the impostor up and down one last time, then smiled with satisfaction.</p><v></v><p><d>‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she exclaimed, ‚Äúif you can keep it like this until we reach Hershel, it‚Äôll be perfect!‚Äù</d></p><v></v><p><d>‚ÄúI hope I‚Äôll manage‚Ä¶‚Äù</d></p><v></v><p><d>‚ÄúJust relax. As far as I‚Äôve seen it, it only happens against your will when you‚Äôre under stress; so if you manage to stay calm, you should be fine! I‚Äôm sure you can do it.‚Äù</d></p><v></v><p>And she concluded her last sentence by jokingly giving a small flick on the underside of their hat, momentarily exposing the replica‚Äôs face. In response, they yelped in surprise and immediately caught it, cowering under it and burying their head all the way to the tip of their nose. Claire still saw a few light tremors on their body, evoking the ripples one would rather expect to see on stagnant water, traversing several surfaces which should normally be composed of solid and inert materials. Fortunately, this peculiarity had remained discreet, and lasted for only a few short seconds: it comforted her in the idea that, for better or for worse, it would most likely be the best they would manage to do for the moment.</p><p>The hat rose slowly and timidly, but even once their eyes became visible, their gaze was once again determined to remain as far away from any living thing as possible.</p><v></v><p><d>‚ÄúBut even if I can stay like this‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll want to keep this up for long. The name, the outfit‚Ä¶ Even if you‚Äôre okay with it, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ wrong.‚Äù</d></p><v></v><p><d>‚ÄúIt‚Äôll only be for the trip, then,‚Äù Dimitri agreed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure that you will find something that works for you sooner or later.‚Äù</d></p><v></v><p>He was, of course, very far from rejoicing in the disarray of others; however, he had to admit that hearing this kind of concern coming from their mouth brought him both satisfaction and comfort. After all, it was just more proof that this entity shared their sense of ethics: and it was therefore the best way for him to have more trust in their new friend, and to regain his own confidence.</p><v></v><p><d>‚ÄúI see that everything is settled,‚Äù he finally concluded with a shy little smile. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ I suppose this is where we part ways?‚Äù</d></p><v></v><p><d>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not coming?‚Äù the stranger asked, raising their head suddenly, perplexed and visibly disappointed.</d></p><v></v><p><d>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ probably not the best idea,‚Äù he admitted with a sigh. ‚ÄúBut I will be around if you need me, I promise.‚Äù</d></p><v></v><p><d>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because of me, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù</d></p><v></v>
<p>Seeing the young non-woman lower their gaze once more with shame, he found himself quite distraught; he bit his lip, wished to answer immediately, but stopped himself just as quickly. Claire crossed her arms severely and stared at him with sudden contempt, which made him shiver; but he still could not find in him the strength to answer.</p><v></v><p><d>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs normal. I understand,‚Äù the entity continued as they succeeded, against all laws of physics, in hiding even more of their face under their hat. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt want to be around me right now, either.‚Äù</d></p><v></v><p>This was too much for Claire, who huffed in disbelief and instantly turned around, now heading for the door and only stopping once her hand was just a few inches away from the handle. Dimitri looked at her discreetly with a clearly visible pinch in his heart; but when his attention returned to the third person present in the room, his pain had remained, and was well addressed to them.</p><v></v><p><d>‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt imagine this, I promise that it has nothing to do with you,‚Äù he confessed in as soft a whisper as he could, praying that Claire couldn‚Äôt hear him.</d></p><v></v><p><d>‚ÄúReally? Then why‚Ä¶?‚Äù</d></p><v></v><p>As their only answer, the man‚Äôs eyes had very fleetingly diverged towards the place where stood the woman who was now waiting in silence with irritation.</p><v></v><p><d>‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt ask. And don‚Äôt tell her, it‚Äôs really not important. I‚Äôd still rather she‚Ä¶ Ah, never mind.‚Äù</d></p><v></v><p>A curious, confused pair of eyebrows was raised for a moment; but Dimitri‚Äôs insistent, concerned looks, and his words repeating over and over again that the issue was completely unrelated to them, eventually convinced it to return to its normal position. The scientist considered the fact that no visible change in their appearance had taken place, as evidence that the child had indeed been reassured and calmed down; and a thin, but sincere smile came to him.</p><v></v><p><d>‚ÄúGood luck; but don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôre in good hands.‚Äù</d></p><v></v><p>And as he finished talking, the child had already left to join their double, leaving him with only a grateful wave of their hand, and a smile identical to his.</p><v></v><p>The door closed behind the two twins‚Ä¶ and Dimitri took a long second to close his eyes and take a deep breath. Once he knew for certain that he was finally alone, he reached his desk in the corner of their laboratory, grabbed a chair, and collapsed in it.</p><v></v><p>So much had happened in such a short amount of time; he really needed some calm and silence to finally process the entirety of the situation, and to recover from it.</p><p>Within the span of a single hour, he had realised that Bill was about to proceed with the experiment in spite of his warnings; he had run a real marathon through the campus and the streets, all the while imagining a plethora of possible scenarios, most of which including as their last act the tragic and gory death of the love of his life; he had arrived <i>just</i> in time to stop a major catastrophe, or at least one that would have occurred, had the entity not appeared; and up to this very moment, his racing heart was still very well aware of the fact that it had been a close call‚Äîfar too close.</p><p>Thanks to the new mystery that had come to entertain and distract her, Claire had surely already forgotten all about it, and he was very happy for her that she did; but just knowing that her life had come so close to ending, in such an abrupt way‚Ä¶ No, truly, he needed some time to catch his breath; needed some time away from any distractions, mundane or strange; needed some time to convince himself that yes:</p><p>Yes.</p><p>It was over.</p><p>Everything was alright.</p><v></v>
<p>He had been saddened yet again when the stranger had believed that his need for quietness was somehow related to them; of course they had not realised, even Claire had not realised. Their concern had been justified, of course, and had some truth to it; but with all that had happened before‚Ä¶ Dimitri could only feel a certain gratitude towards them, as strange as it might seem.</p><p>All in all, the appearance of this strange entity of unknown origins‚Ä¶ It had been shocking, terrifying, disturbing no doubt, and the images he had had the misfortune of witnessing would most certainly come back to haunt his nightmares for months to come; but in hindsight, it had only ever been just that, and nothing more. Better still, by putting this incongruous scene within a context which was at first glance completely unrelated, but at the same time whose outcome depended so heavily on the unfolding of these last events‚Ä¶ This phenomenon had turned out to be a blessing in disguise, in view of the lives that had been saved: for he was sure of it. Given the state of their laboratory, given the positions and attitudes of Bill and Claire, he was now convinced that the distraction that the young entity had brought was the only thing that had interrupted their experiment, and which had allowed him to arrive in the nick of time in order to cancel it once and for all.</p><p>In addition to this, was the fact that Claire had achieved the miracle of befriending them, and the fact that he had managed to find in him the strength to trust them both. After talking to them for some time, Dimitri had concluded that the last fifty minutes had been far more traumatising for the creature in question, especially if they really had the mind of a child, than they had been for him. Or at least, this second trauma had been overall far less, compared to the one he had gone through just prior to it.</p><p>In a nutshell: the event he needed to recover from was hardly this incredible encounter, and the reason why he decided to stay behind‚Ä¶ was once again linked to his personal life and feelings, and almost nothing else. He had already been through so many emotions in such a short time‚Ä¶ His heart just wasn‚Äôt ready to suffer again, and he certainly did not want Claire to worry about such nonsense. After all‚Ä¶</p><v></v>
<p>Hershel was a good man. He knew it. He was the perfect man for her, she had made the right choice, and he was happy for both of them, one as much as the other, really he was.</p><p>So, when she had claimed with great joy and pride that the one she really wanted to solve the mystery with was Hershel, and not him‚Ä¶ He had felt as if his heart had been stabbed, but he had not been surprised, and he was happy for her. He‚Ä¶ He didn‚Äôt have to intervene. She had been polite and caring, as she always was‚Ä¶ But contrary to what she said, she did not need him.</p><v></v><p>On the other hand, given the state in which their prototype time machine was, a small explosion had indeed taken place. Miraculously, this one had been almost harmless, far more than the one he had predicted and had so feared to find, had he arrived too late; but, in its own way, on a much smaller but still not completely insignificant scale, this explosion had created quite a mess.</p><p>He stood up, walked a few aimless steps; and looking down, he saw his feet come into contact with shattered pieces of doors that had come off their hinges, and piles of paper scattered on the floor.</p><v></v>
<p>There, he had one more reason for staying.</p><p>Someone would have to clean this up, after all.</p>
<p class=bar></p><p class=clock></p>
<p>With only his broom and the debris as company, Dimitri still found his haven of peace within a calm and tranquillity that had arrived at just the right time. Since Bill had gone who-knows-where and Claire was busy solving an intriguing mystery, he found great relief and a welcome serenity in the idea that he had all the rest of the afternoon to clear his mind. He took the time to appreciate this moment, cleaning their laboratory at his own pace, alone with his thoughts; and some time later, once the task would be completed, he would be able to tell himself with great joy that he had fully deserved to call it a day.</p><p>It took him a while to remember that this day was actually supposed to be a day off for him; once he remembered, he couldn‚Äôt help but laugh sadly, and could not find the strength to feel any other emotion.</p><v></v>
<p>Slowly regaining his breath and composure, he put one last pile of papers back in place on his desk. Now, only the heaviest task remained: the debris of the time machine‚Äôs doors, which had exploded when the entity arrived, from what Claire had told him. These doors were made of a dense metal alloy, and it would therefore be difficult for him to lift them, let alone repair them on his own; but he could all the same at least put them in a corner of the laboratory and out of the way for the time being.</p><p>It would still require a lot of physical effort, and he sighed in anticipation. Walking slowly towards the messy pile of coppery metal, he took some time to appreciate these last moments of peace, bade a heart-breaking farewell to his scoliosis-free days, and‚Ä¶ His gaze was suddenly distracted by a strange and unexpected glimmer of green.</p><v></v>
<p>Intrigued, his walking pace quickened ever so slightly until he could face the object of his attention, and he leaned over to the very spot where, again according to Claire, the entity had appeared. Without hesitation, he reached out and picked up a little item which, presumably, did not belong in such a place. Now that he had it in front of his eyes, he only became all the more surprised: measuring just over an inch long, this was by far the smallest floppy disk he had ever seen. The inscription written on it was just as cryptic, so he paid it little attention beyond a slight raise of his eyebrows; but no, these words which he knew individually, but whose arrangement meant absolutely nothing to him, were far less fascinating than the object on which they had been printed.</p><p>What kind of technology could it be? He had first thought of a floppy disk, but he was not so sure anymore. It seemed obvious to him that its primary purpose was to store some information in the form of digital data; but how? It was certainly not a drum memory, partly for its size, partly because this object was far too flat to be able to stack ferromagnetic cylinders. Was a miniature disk hidden in its core? No, these small parallel metallic grooves rather resembled the traces left by a memory using tori; and yet, it didn‚Äôt come close either, it seemed different‚Ä¶ He also eliminated plated-wire memory out of the possible candidates for the same reason. No, really, the presence and nature of this little black and green square was confusing, and the fact that he could not fathom how the information it contained was stored made his curiosity grow all the more.</p><v></v>
<p>Had it only been possible for him to recognise the exact nature of what he had in his hands, and what it all meant, he could have deduced so much, and so little at the same time. He could have understood that at this precise moment, the mystery as a whole had thickened all the more, and had taken a turn so much stranger and terrifying still: because the very existence of this small object was a blatant snub in the direction of the universe itself, in its integrity as well as in its entirety.</p><v></v><p>Fortunately, or unfortunately, Dimitri knew none of this: as a result, his only reaction was one of mild and transient confusion, his only deduction that it was definitely related to the entity and probably belonged to them, and his only action was to store the small flat square in a pocket of his white coat, with the intention of thinking about it later, and returning it to its owner the next time they would meet. Maybe tell Claire about it, too, in case it might be a clue in their little investigation. If the entity really was only a child, then he strongly doubted that they had the necessary knowledge to answer questions as advanced as the ones which now accumulated in his mind.</p>
