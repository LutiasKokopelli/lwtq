<p class=em>&ldquo;How about &lsquo;Ashley&rsquo;, then? Ashley sounds nice.&rdquo;</p><v></v>
<p>The shape-shifter hummed and sighed, but once again, a few seconds of stroking their (Claire&rsquo;s) chin with a sad and lost look were enough for the woman to understand that this offer was not to their liking either. With the black pouch now sitting on their lap and half covered by one hand, their index nervously tapped its dull surface in a somewhat irregular rhythm.</p>
<p>As they had mentioned right from the start, the name &lsquo;Celeste&rsquo; was far from satisfying them, and they were very glad that they had not met the need to use it at all.</p><p>They were rather undecisive at the prospect of forging a new name from scratch, but since they couldn&rsquo;t find their own and probably would not be able to do so before a long while&hellip; At least being given the possibility to choose a temporary replacement was the best solution they had at their disposal.</p><p>In the same vein, they had also made it clear quite early that they would rather find an androgynous name; after all, they could not even remember their own gender.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;Perhaps giving names at random would be inefficient by this point.&rdquo; Hershel mused, putting down his teacup and silently standing up. &ldquo;Let me see if I can find my dictionary.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>The scientist lit up and congratulated him on his great idea, and she soon came to follow him. They searched around and through the man&rsquo;s shelves, and it took about two minutes before she would start teasing her boyfriend about his lack of organisational skills.</p>
<p>The entity remained seated on the couch and silently took their teacup, holding it within both hands and letting its warmth permeate their trembling fingers. Discreetly, they looked at the two with a timid, but happy smile.</p><p>Just like Claire, the professor had not taken long at all to accept them, somehow; once the initial shock behind them and the soothing aroma of tea filling the room, almost all traces of tension or awkwardness had gradually faded away.</p><p>It surprised them immensely that they would be able to stare at such unbelievable situation right in the eyes and shrug it off so easily, and part of them almost wondered if they were merely pretending to be alright with it, if only partially so&hellip; But they certainly would not complain.</p>
<p>They still felt lost, and were almost ready to give up on the idea that they would ever gain any answers. And yet, sitting here in this charming little living room, looking at these two lovebirds who were such brilliant minds, yet all at the same time such sweet and naÃ¯ve people who could not possibly imagine what catastrophe had almost separated them in the most tragic way possible&hellip;</p><p>They would never dare say that it made them feel at home; but&hellip; They felt welcome.</p>
<p>These two people, who they had just met, but who at the same time were not at all strangers to them&hellip; They truly made them feel like they belonged here.</p><p>It was not true, and they knew it far too well, the item on their lap standing as the perfect reminder; but these young adults were quite talented at making them forget what little they knew, and believe otherwise.</p>
<p>As they finally got their hands on the long-awaited dictionary, the couple continued talking to each other fondly, now back to listing names and sharing their thoughts on each of them. By listening to their excitement, one could almost wonder if they had forgotten who they were supposed to name in the first place, and had instead started thinking of someone else entirely.</p>
<p>Without realizing it, the shape-shifter&rsquo;s mind had meanwhile started wandering around, taking a growing interest in their surroundings. Books were everywhere and in a bit of a mess, but the large windows let the sun shine through, shedding enough warm light in the room to compensate for it. Many artifacts from various eras and colors could be found here and there on the shelves, sometimes put on display, sometimes accidentally hidden between a few misplaced books.</p><p>This place felt cosy and welcoming; and more than just this, it felt personal and sincere. It was humble, pretentionless. All in all, it&nbsp;reflected the professor perfectly; and, if only in this very moment, they wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted it any other way.</p>
<p>Still in the midst of their lost and directionless thoughts, the entity found themselves by chance looking with particular interest at some pottery and short statuettes that the professor was keeping on the upper shelves.</p><p>One of them specifically had a rather funny face; somewhat distorted, either by the ravages of time or by the original clumsiness of the hands that crafted it; but still likeable in its awkwardness, if&nbsp;this could make any sense. They caught themselves smiling at it, as if it could somehow respond.</p><p>This craft was not particularly intricate, and neither did it look special in any way; and yet, they somehow found some form of familiarity while looking at it. This silly expression, this material, this small and discreet form; among many things, it reminded them of the infinite malleability of&hellip;</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;Clay.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>Two interjections of slight surprise echoed in unison, as both scholars turned their heads back towards them.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;Clay?&rdquo; Claire parroted, curious to hear them after their long absence. &ldquo;As in &lsquo;Clayton&rsquo;&hellip;?&rdquo; She turned to look at her boyfriend and laughed softly. &ldquo;That would be a little redundant.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;No, just Clay.&rdquo; They stared down, frowning and pursing their lips with always that same expression of doubt and, in some way&hellip; resignation. &ldquo;I&nbsp;don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; they added, &ldquo;it just&hellip; It seems fitting.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>The couple exchanged a silent look. Hershel stiffled a short breath as he turned back to them with a soft smile.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;Alright then.&rdquo; he concluded, nodding encouragingly. &ldquo;It is a pleasure to meet you, Clay.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>The newly named entity gave him in return a shy, but warm smile. They jokingly brought a hand to their chest and bowed slightly.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;The pleasure&rsquo;s all mine, Professor.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>The man&rsquo;s smile dropped all at once. Contrary to their intent, and to their great surprise, the reaction that their words had provoked in the abovementioned professor was one of complete shock&hellip; and of sudden suspicion.</p><v></v>
<!--
"Did you say 'professor'...?"
"I mean... yeah? Everybody calls you that."
"Nobody calls me that. I haven't even started teaching yet."
-->
<p><d>&ldquo;&hellip;Where did this come from?&rdquo; he asked, taken aback. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t even started teaching yet. And&hellip; How would you know about this? Did Claire tell you?&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>The woman in question took a short inhale, then silently set her teacup back on the table before going back to sitting up straight. Unmoving, from the corner of her eyes, she sent a suddenly calculating look at the shape-shifter: there was not a single ounce of surprise in her gaze.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;&hellip;I was willing to wait a bit more and see if you would bring up the topic on your own,&rdquo; she justified calmly with a light shrug, &ldquo;but since we reached this point&hellip; Would now be a good time to finally address how you already knew so much? About Hershel, about the hat; the list could go on. So, where did you learn all this?&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>They should have known.</p><v></v><p>They should have known that these two <i>had</i>, in fact, been keeping their questions to themselves on purpose in order to put them at ease and lower their guard; but not for a single moment had their oddities escaped their attention, and now&hellip;</p><v></v><p>Now was the time to be questioned.</p><v></v>
<p>Feeling cornered, a shiver ran down their spine. Before they knew it, their anxiousness had gotten the better of them, and despite the fact that they had realized that they had started shifting forms again, they found themselves powerless to stop it. If anything, their realization only increased their panic all the more, thus losing what little control they still had over their form.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;Ack&ndash; No!&rdquo; Clay struggled for a few long seconds, fighting to settle on something, anything; but they soon gave up, burying an amorphous head in a pair of ever changing hands, sighing tensely in shame and fear. &ldquo;Not&nbsp;again&hellip;!&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>Having once again lost all sense of stability in their appearance, what now looked like a boiling mass of an undefined substance brought equally undefined legs to its chest and surrounded it all with trembling undefined arms, eventually forming some sort of ever shifting ball of terror and despair that surrounded the black pouch from all sides.</p><p>Neither adult had expected this outburst, and the sight paralyzed them, making them all but forget for a time the reason behind it, and making them regret bringing the topic so suddenly.</p><p>Claire shakily stood up, trying to pacify them as gently as she could.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;C-calm down, we&rsquo;re not accusing you of anything&hellip;!&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>She sent a quick worried glance at Hershel, silently asking him for help, but she only found him even more lost than she was. She had to remind herself that, contrary to her, this was the first time that he was cursed with such disturbing spectacle.</p><p>Her eyes now back to the entity, she slowly sat down on her seat across the table and tried her best to reason them.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;Back at the lab, when you copied me but also took on this new form&hellip; You admitted right away that you had seen it before.&rdquo; she said encouragingly. &ldquo;You could have easily taken Dimitri&rsquo;s compliment and said that you had imagined it entirely, but you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>Once again sending a short look at her boyfriend, she was glad to see that he had understood perfectly what she meant. Having now been granted this major piece of evidence that he was lacking, he traded what little sternness he had managed to keep for what now appeared to be signs of some prudent, confused concern.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;Ah, I see now&hellip; This&nbsp;proves rather well that you had no real intention of hiding anything from us, doesn&rsquo;t it? You simply didn&rsquo;t feel ready to talk about it just yet.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>Slowly and timidly, two trembling wet eyes snuck out of a pair of crossed arms.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;I&hellip; I-it&rsquo;s quite&hellip; difficult to explain.&rdquo; they muttered in shame, stuttering in part due to their unstable voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure&hellip; if it&rsquo;s a good idea.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;We have time. There is no rush.&rdquo; the man stated as softly as he could, trying not to express the turmoil that this sight was causing in his stomach.</d></p><v></v>
<p>It took a little more time for these words of comfort to take effect, but Clay eventually managed to settle on a single form. Hershel bit his lip, but said nothing.</p><p>They looked down in order to check who they were now impersonating, and winced; but as they were just about to try and correct it, the young professor raised his hands. His face still debating between distress and calm, cold reason, he gestured them gently but resolutely to take a deep breath&hellip; and to keep things as they were now, pleasant or not.</p><p>Judging that there had indeed been enough chaos already, they did not need much more convincing; though it was quite obvious that they did not feel at ease with this appearance at all.</p>
<p>This time, both adults finally came to the realization that this impression of Hershel Layton looked&hellip; older. Some pieces of the puzzle were finally starting to make some semblance of sense.</p><p>Claire&rsquo;s hands tensed up, as she brought them on her lap. It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be what she was now starting to think about&hellip; or could it?</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;Claire said that you had admitted to having&hellip; &lsquo;seen this before.&rsquo;&rdquo; Hershel started slowly. &ldquo;What did you mean by this?&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;&hellip;It means exactly that.&rdquo; Clay sighed gravely. Looking away, they bit their lip. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&hellip; I already knew about everyone before I arrived here.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>The man squinted in doubt and confusion, but he decided to keep his silence for the time being. It was now obvious that, due to not being present in the laboratory when it had all started, he had missed a massive amount of information; and thus, he had a lot to catch up on.</p><p>In fact, without realizing it, Claire herself had been concealing from him most of what she had experienced beforehand, due to Clay knowing the context, and due to him being the only one still in the dark. Thankfully, for now, the shape-shifter did not sound like they were finished just yet; and so, he gladly chose to be patient and wait for more hints to come.</p><p>Clay&rsquo;s eyes were once again lost and unfocused; but their mind was working actively, carefully weighting their words, and their arms once again squeezed the black pouch even more. Then, after inhaling sharply, they turned back to look at them with a conflicted and pained expression.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;Claire, do you&hellip;&rdquo; Stopping mid-sentence, they once again bit their lip tensely. &ldquo;If I were to say that I&hellip; that I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be here. That if things had gone the way I know them, I&hellip;&rdquo; Another pause. They gulped. &ldquo;&hellip;If I hadn&rsquo;t shown up in your lab. What do you think would have happened?&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>A great silence befell the room. Claire&rsquo;s eyes widened. She did not respond, she did not move; but if one were to look at her with enough care, one would see that she was subtly shaking her head from right to left, some form of denial growing on her pale face.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;Dimitri made it quite clear, I think. And&hellip; He was right. If you had gone through with the experiment as Bill had planned it&hellip; You wouldn&rsquo;t have made it out alive.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>Hershel was at a loss for words. Claire had never told him what the experiment was supposed to be about, and never had he expected it to be this dangerous. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, sternly pushing aside the horrendous scenarios that his mind was now starting to imagine, pushing aside these fictive sights of a world without her.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;How could you possibly know what would have happened, since it didn&rsquo;t? This is purely hypothetical&hellip;&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>Was it reason or fear that convinced him to refute their words? He&nbsp;did not wish to think about it; but the lack of conviction in his rebuttal said all.</p>
<p>Claire shuddered; looked at Clay straight in the eyes; they sent her back the very same, knowing look.</p><p>Not a word had been exchanged between the two, but both understood that her deductions had now reached a conclusion, and that it was not one to be taken lightly.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;You&hellip; traveled through time? Until <i>here</i>?&rdquo; She jumped out of her seat, her face losing what little color it normally had. &ldquo;And you <i>changed</i> your own past!?&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;Not on purpose! I don&rsquo;t even know how I got here!&rdquo; they instantly retorted in panic.</d></p><v></v>
<p>Time travel. Somehow, spending half an hour in the presence of an unknown shape-shifting entity will give you the capability of accepting nearly any sort of fantasy as a believable theory.</p><p>Well, to be fair, Hershel knew the basics of what his girlfriend was working on, and so the idea of a time traveling individual appearing in a laboratory whose topic of research just so happened to be time travel as well, suddenly became a lot less far-fetched.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;But, well, now that it&rsquo;s <i>already done</i>&hellip;&rdquo; Clay muttered, scratching the back of their head awkwardly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit late to change it back, I&rsquo;d say. Sounds good to me.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p><d>Claire was shaking. &ldquo;I should have <i>died</i> back then&hellip;!?&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;P-please don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;should.&rsquo;&rdquo; Hershel begged in a hollow voice, now feeling light-headed.</d></p><v></v>
<p>The accidental time traveler looked guiltily to their left; to their right; to the floor. They pursed their lips childishly.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;W-well, let&rsquo;s look on the bright side: the universe hasn&rsquo;t exploded yet, and I haven&rsquo;t started blinking out of reality or whatever. So&hellip; it&rsquo;s all good. Right?&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>The physicist came back to sitting down, but far more out of necessity than out of politeness.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;Clay, this is&hellip; I have no words.&rdquo; she uttered shakily. &ldquo;Surely, research on time travel is more advanced in your original time, but here&hellip; As you know, Dimitri found a mistake in our plans, so there is still a lot of work to be done. And with such mistake&hellip; I wonder what could be possible.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>Not knowing what else to do, the archaeologist absent-mindedly seized the teapot and refilled all three cups, his sweetheart&rsquo;s going first. Claire grabbed hers immediately, taking a long sip then squeezing the porcelain within her hands.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;For all we know, your current condition&mdash; some sort of molecular instability wouldn&rsquo;t be out of the equation as a potential explanation? We would need to research this in more detail, but for now, it could be explained by anything&mdash; by your meddling with time, or by you being present in your own past, or just because the time machine that sent you here was incomplete as well&hellip;&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; I-I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not <i>that</i> bad, really&hellip;&rdquo; they tried to reply unconvincingly as their eyes again darted away, a nervous thumb tapping the soft surface of their small rectangular pouch. They soon interrupted themselves when they saw the copy of Hershel Layton&rsquo;s hair curl up and magically turn orange. They pursed their lips once again, losing their forced smile entirely, as they clicked their tongue and corrected: <span style=font-size:85%>&ldquo;&hellip;Alright, maybe it is that bad.&rdquo;</span></d></p><v></v>
<p>Taking a deep breath, trying to bring back some rationality in the room in hopes of chasing away at the very least <i>some</i> of the tension that had accumulated during the past dozen minutes&hellip; Hershel brought a hand to his chin.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;How much time into our future did you come from?&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>As his only answer, Clay stared down at the black pouch. It was hard to tell whether they kept their silence because they did not know, or because they did not want to say it.</p><p>Undeterred, the archaeologist crossed his arms and blinked sternly.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;Clay, do you know Luke Triton?&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;H-huh? Why?&rdquo; Startled by the sudden change of attitude and topic, they jumped in surprise&mdash; and lost at the very least two entire feet in the process. Blinking, they looked down, now seeing a blue sweater and far smaller hands. &ldquo;&hellip;oops.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>For once, the man was completely unfazed by this new transformation; and in fact, he made no effort of hiding a discreet smile of satisfaction and victory.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;Claire, how old would you say he looks? Ten? Eleven?&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p><d>Claire shook her head. &ldquo;Luke takes a lot after Brenda.&rdquo; she argued. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s quite short, just like her. It&rsquo;s probably twelve, maybe even thirteen years old.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;About ten years in our future, then. Hm.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>The shape-shifter seized the brim of an adolescent Luke&rsquo;s cap and burrowed within it, feeling their cheeks warm up in embarrassment. They did, however, find out that this small form felt far less uncomfortable than that of either adult. It still wasn&rsquo;t it, but&hellip; it suited them better, they realized. Perhaps this was why they had switched to it so easily.</p><p>Hershel took some long seconds to ponder the weight of the consequences that would have resulted from Clay&rsquo;s actions. Their age was impossible to tell, as with everything else regarding their true identity; but if one were to consider that they appeared to act rather naÃ¯vely and childishly at times; if they were young enough, then perhaps&hellip;</p><p>He frowned gravely. Lowering his voice, he asked the scientist:</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;Ten years is a really long time. As for the reason why they can&rsquo;t remember who they were&hellip; Could it be that when they changed their past, they also erased their own existence in the process?&rdquo;</d></p><v></v><p>She breathed heavily, slightly shaking her head, but undecisive and not willing to outright refute his hypothesis just yet.</p><p>She whispered back:</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;It seems rather unlikely, since they still can remember events that should have been erased as well. But&hellip; I&nbsp;suppose that this isn&rsquo;t beyond the realm of possibility. It&rsquo;s too early to tell.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>By all means, as much as their research had dabbled into the theory of time travel, neither she nor her two colleagues had spent much time and energy thinking about the possibility of changing History and creating paradoxes. They had always thought that the simplest and most natural way of looking at it was that only stable time loops could exist; but now, this strange amnesiac and faceless time traveler brought her to question their initial model.</p><p>If Clay had indeed fallen victim to a classic grandfather paradox, then perhaps the universe&rsquo;s answer to them preventing their own existence was not to outright delete the cause of the change in History, since this is what would generate the paradox in the first place&hellip; but to rather erase all information related to them: their identity, their form, their memories; until in the end, all that was left would be something lost and unstable, yet regardless required in order for time to keep its stability&hellip;</p><p>This was far too crazy to consider on its own, and the scientist was far from convinced that this could possibly be the entire truth; but looking at Clay&hellip; it at least was an idea worth considering.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;If we were to look at what occurred during these ten years&hellip;&rdquo; Hershel mused, this time addressing the child: &ldquo;Do you have any idea as to what you could have changed in the long term by stopping this experiment?&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>Clay pursed their lips, staring at him straight in the eyes with a rather hard to decipher expression. They brought both hands to their mouth and joined them in a concerned, deeply thoughtful gesture, letting their elbows rest on their knees, sandwiching the black pouch between their arms and their lap.</p><p>They took a massive, loud inhalation; then released their answer.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;Well, to give you the entire truth&hellip; Just by showing up back then and there, as we&rsquo;ve established&hellip; I kinda sorta accidentally saved Claire from certain death. But that&rsquo;s not the whole of it.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>Both adults gave a sharp nod, having suspected as much; after all, this was the entire reason behind their query. Clay once again breathed deeply, but they soon continued:</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;&hellip;So, since the time machine didn&rsquo;t explode, then the nearby buildings were also spared, which means that we shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about a vengeful orphan creating an entire futuristic London replica and eventually trying to destroy the real London in order to prove a point against corruption or something, and Dimitri also won&rsquo;t join him in his evil plan because since Claire&rsquo;s alive he has no reason to want to go back in time to save her&hellip; Oh, and I guess I also probably interfered with politics in some way, because I may or may not have stopped Bill from becoming Prime Minister too&hellip;?&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>As if all this were not enough already, the time traveler felt the need to add:</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m complaining, all of those are <i>great</i> improvements. Probably. I&rsquo;m not completely sure about the politics thing, for all we know Bill&rsquo;s opponents wouldn&rsquo;t make good Prime Ministers either.&rdquo; They looked to the side awkwardly. &ldquo;&hellip; Was Bill even bad as a Prime Minister? I&rsquo;m not sure about the standards.&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>Whether they were expecting an answer or not, they obtained none.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;I literally did nothing by myself on purpose, but&hellip;&rdquo; They pursed their lips, still staring at the floor. Their gaze went back up, and they shrugged in the most undecisive way possible, playfully throwing their hands in the air for emphasis. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome?&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>Claire&rsquo;s mouth was ready to eat flies, and Hershel looked like he could fall over any second.</p>
<p>The unknown child (because by this point, this just <i>had</i> to be a child for them to not realize the immense gravity of their previous words) pursed their lips and, once again, looked down at the floor guiltily for some time. Stroking the black pouch, which now felt much bigger to them, they took a deep apologetic breath. Was there any way they could appease them?</p><p>When at the very least two full minutes of silence had passed, they couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore.</p><v></v>
<p><d>&ldquo;&hellip;In any case, by this point&hellip; It&rsquo;s too late to save me now, right? So, uh, while we&rsquo;re at it&hellip;&rdquo;</d></p><v></v>
<p>The two adults shared a confused, and increasingly concerned look. They seemed to have some sort of idea as to what could come next, but they preferred hoping that the child would listen to reason and go in a different direction.</p><p>Unfortunately for the couple&rsquo;s sanity, after about three seconds and a half of active thinking, Clay raised a head to look back at them&hellip; and now was shining on their face a devilish grin which, thankfully not literally, sliced their face in half. Their eyes brightly lit with childish wonder and mischief, they announced proudly:</p><v></v>
<p class=em><d>&ldquo;I say we do it again.&rdquo;</d></p>
