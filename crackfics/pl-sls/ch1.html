<div class=chcol><div class=chctn><div class=ch><article><h1>Chapter I<hr></h1><p class=em>Promising someone to meet a friend at their home, and going through with it, was usually quite trivial.</p><p>Now, bringing a shape-shifter with the tendency to transform with as much ease and lack of thought as they could breathe, from a laboratory in the busy center of London, to a small house that stood still in the same city, but far enough to warrant a bus trip and a good few dozen minutes, all this without catching the attention of any bystanders&hellip; This was much less so.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;You seem&hellip; <i>relatively</i> good at keeping Claire&rsquo;s form.&rdquo; Dimitri had been quick to observe.</d></p>
<p>Sure, whenever the topic of a certain Hershel Layton was brought up, the face of a man in a top hat would systematically resurface, for some strange reason; but otherwise, out of all the people they had impersonated during the past fifteen minutes, Claire&rsquo;s image was by far the one they could keep stable for the longest.<br>It certainly had to do with the fact that the original was right by their side, but it also certainly had to do with the fact that she was the only person who had ever given them explicit consent to being impersonated.<br>That, and&hellip; by all means, the lady&rsquo;s spark, optimism and courage had completely won over the shape-shifter&rsquo;s heart and trust. Perhaps there was some &lsquo;wish to follow their model&rsquo; psychology hidden somewhere in there, even.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I could always pretend that I have a twin sister.&rdquo; Claire&nbsp;smiled mischievously. &ldquo;As for a name, if anyone asks, let&rsquo;s say&hellip;&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Celeste?&rdquo; they blurted out instantly.</d></p>
<p><d>She blinked. &ldquo;&hellip;Yes. Celeste. Why not.&rdquo; Raising her eyebrows in surprise, she slightly cocked her head to the side. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; funny that you would say that. I was thinking the exact same thing!&rdquo; She crossed her arms jokingly. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t happen to also read minds while you&rsquo;re at it, would you?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><i>That could explain the hat</i>, she didn&rsquo;t add.</p>
<p>Claire was trying to remain rigorous and rational, and kept telling herself that using a horror novella as reference was far from being a reliable source of solid evidence; but she was still reminded of the fact that the shape-shifting monster from the novel did, in fact, have telepathic abilities of some sort.<br>This combined with the fact that fifteen minutes ago, the real shape-shifter had only woken after she had made a brief physical contact with it, resulting in both of them receiving some sort of shock&hellip; It had certainly felt like a standard shock coming from static electricity, and so she wished to keep it at that; but she also did not want to disregard any hypothesis before it had been properly disproven.</p>
<p>Telepathy was a ridiculous idea to consider&hellip; But so was the idea of a being able to change shape within seconds, possibly ignoring the laws of conservation of mass in the process.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Well&hellip; Um, even twin sisters don&rsquo;t look completely identical, though.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Instead of answering her question, the shape-shifter had merely looked away and diverted the topic towards a different issue.<br>They were already copying her exact features, by now having truly reached a level of impersonation such that the only clue Dimitri had left in order to distinguish the two was, beyond their demeanor, the black pouch that only the impostor held. And yet, they closed their eyes and breathed deeply, which both scientists had by now learned to recognize as the signal that they were about to transform willingly &mdash; for a change.</p>
<p>Curious to discover what they were planning, but wishing not to disturb them in the process and end up with yet another accidental living nightmare, the humans shared a glance, then came back to look at them.<br>The copy of Claire&rsquo;s face hardly changed, but quite a few alterations were made around it. The glasses evaporated; the hair grew shorter and came to attach itself into a low pony tail; and the replica of Claire&rsquo;s lab coat was entirely replaced with a blue jacket, complete with a few more accessories and color changes in their general attire. Finally, taking one last deep breath, a white straw hat laced with a green ribbon magically came out of their hand, as they put it on their newly shaped head.</p>
<p>The addition of the hat was most certainly so the shape-shifter could have something to hide their ashamed blushing face, and avoid meeting the eyes of others all the more easily.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;So, uh&hellip; How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>It took at least a few more seconds for Dimitri and Claire to overcome their shock.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s incredible.&rdquo; the man came first, genuinely impressed. &ldquo;Did you just imagine this from nothing?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Another question he would have gladly asked was how they could possibly have inorganic accessories such as glasses or hats appear and disappear in an instant; but he had seen it happen enough times already to have given up and simply accepted it for the time being. All that he knew was that these accessories seemed to directly come from the shape-shifter themselves, which&hellip; Well, he simply did not want to think too much about it. He had already gathered enough nightmare material for at the very least a month worth of his future nights as it was.</p>
<p>The one who would soon have to be called &lsquo;Celeste&rsquo; looked away, again, and pressed their hat to further hide their face.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve&hellip; seen it before. Just thought it&rsquo;d fit.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Once again, the two scientists shared a short, silence glance in confusion; but they soon shrugged it off.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Well, if you can keep it like this until we reach Hershel, it&rsquo;ll be perfect.&rdquo; Claire smiled.</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ll manage&hellip;&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Just relax.&rdquo; she assured. &ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;ve seen it, it only happens against your will when you&rsquo;re under stress; which, understandably, has happened a lot until now&hellip; But don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m sure we can make it.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>And she jokingly tipped off the impostor&rsquo;s hat in the process, leading to them instantly catching it and cowering under it.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Regardless, I&rsquo;m&hellip; not sure I&rsquo;ll want to keep that up for long.&rdquo; they admitted, once again their eyes darting away. &ldquo;The name, the outfit&hellip; It just doesn&rsquo;t feel right.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll only be for the trip, then. You can always figure something out later.&rdquo; Dimitri nodded.</d></p>
<p>If anything, hearing the shape-shifter themselves voice this type of concerns and insecurities was all the more reassuring to him as well.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;In this case&hellip; I suppose I will see you off?&rdquo; he added, somewhat shyly.</d></p>
<p>The shape-shifter jolted their head in surprise and confusion.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not coming?&rdquo; they asked.</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; probably not the best idea.&rdquo; Dimitri admitted. &ldquo;But I will be around if you need me, I promise.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>Once again, they looked away in shame. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because of me, isn&rsquo;t it.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>He bit his lip, seemed to want to say something, but he did not answer. Claire crossed her arms in contempt and disappointment, making him flinch slightly; but he did his best to ignore it.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; alright. I understand.&rdquo; they replied, somehow managing to bury their head even deeper within the confines of the straw hat. &ldquo;I&nbsp;wouldn&rsquo;t want to be around me right now, either.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The woman huffed and turned around in a single movement, ready to walk out of the office and only stopping near the door, waiting for the entity to join her. Dimitri eyed her discreetly, then gave them a quick stern look:</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;&hellip; To be entirely honest, that&rsquo;s hardly the whole of it.&rdquo; he confessed as softly as possible, praying that Claire wouldn&rsquo;t hear it. &ldquo;Just&hellip; don&rsquo;t ask. And don&rsquo;t tell her.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The fake Claire raised a pair of eyebrows in extreme surprise and confusion, but when Dimitri insisted that it was unrelated to them specifically, they were thankfully soon convinced and reassured.<br>He took the fact that they did not accidentally change their disguise as proof that they had been pacified, and smiled in return.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Good luck; but don&rsquo;t worry. You&rsquo;re in good hands.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The shape-shifter skittered to their double, only giving him a silent and grateful goodbye gesture before following her out.</p>
<p>The door closed&hellip; and Dimitri took a long second to close his eyes and sigh heavily. When he knew for sure that he was alone, he&nbsp;seized a chair and crashed into it.</p>
<p>So much had happened in such a short amount of time; he really needed a moment to himself so he could process it.<br>In the span of hardly an hour, he had found a mistake in their time machine&rsquo;s plans; he had run a full-on marathon while imagining all possible kinds of scenarios, most of which included the gruesome death of the love of his life; he had just <i>barely</i> made it in time to stop a major catastrophe; and to this moment, he was still overly conscious of how much of a close call it had been.</p>
<p>All things considered, the appearance of this mysterious entity of unknown origins&hellip; It was disturbing, yes, and the images would probably resurface in his nightmares for the following nights; but in the grand scheme of things, it had been just that, and nothing more. If anything, this phenomenon had been a blessing in disguise; he was now quite certain that this unexpected distraction was the only thing that had bought him enough time.<br>Besides, thanks to Claire befriending them, and thanks to him finding the strength to talk to them as well, he had quickly come to the conclusion that this moment had surely been far more traumatizing to them, than it had been to him &mdash; at least, when he compared the emotions he felt due to them with the ones he had been through just prior to it.<br>In a nutshell: the event he really needed to recover from was hardly this encounter, and the reason he had preferred not following them&hellip; had once again much to do with his own personal life, and with how he was not ready to board another roller-coaster.</p>
<p>Hershel was a good man. He knew this. Claire had made the right choice, and he wanted to support her all the way.<br>
So when she had made it clear that the one she truly wished to solve the mystery was Hershel first and foremost, not him&hellip; It&nbsp;stung, but he was happy for her. He&hellip; he needed not intervene. She was being polite and kind, as she always was&hellip; but contrary to what she would say, she didn&rsquo;t need him.</p>
<p>Besides&hellip; judging by the state of their time machine, a small explosion of some kind did, in fact, happen after all. It had been harmless, thankfully, far more than the one he had dreaded to find; but it still had created quite a mess.<br>Looking down, his feet came into contact with a pile of bent unhinged doors, and a multitude of disorganized papers.</p>
<p>This was yet another good reason to stay behind.<br>Someone would have to clean this up, after all.</p>
<hr class=bar><hr class=clock>
<p>With the sole company of the broom and debris, Dimitri still found refuge in the very welcome tranquility and silence. And now, with Bill having stormed off and Claire being gone to solve a mystery, he&nbsp;found solace in the idea that he would be able to empty his head in peace. He was appreciating his time cleaning up the office at his own pace, alone with his thoughts, and soon, he would gladly be able to call it a day.</p>
<p>The pile of papers had been put back in order; now was time to get to the heavy part. The doors would be quite difficult to lift up, and he certainly would not be able to put them back in place on his own&hellip; but he could at least deposit them in a corner of the room until the next day, so they would no longer block the passage.</p>
<p>Sighing in anticipation to the physical effort he would have to provide, he walked towards the messy pile of coppery metal, and&hellip; His gaze was quickly attracted to an unusual spark of green.<br>Curious, he came closer and crouched down, writing a mental note to himself that this was the exact spot where the shape-shifter had been found; and without hesitation, he picked up the item that had seemingly no purpose being here.</p>
<p>His eyes widened, intrigued. Measuring barely more than an inch squared, this was by far the tiniest floppy disk he had ever seen; but even more shocking than the small device&rsquo;s nature alone, what sent a chill down his spine as soon as he got to read it was the inscription printed on it.</p>
<p align=center><i>Professor Layton and the Unwound Future</i></p>
<p>Had he truly been able to recognize what exacly he had found and what this meant, he would have deduced how much this seemed to explain about the entity&rsquo;s unexpected knowledge, and all at once how little this would tell about why or how this could be; as the very existence of this tiny device should be impossible.</p>
<p>Fortunately, or unfortunately, he knew none of this; so instead, he merely frowned in confusion, vaguely deduced that it had to be related to either Claire or the entity, and pocketed it with the intent of looking at it later. Perhaps ask Claire about it, in case it belonged to her somehow.</p>

<div class=bar><span>September 28, 1953 &ndash; 13:38</span></div>
<p>By some sort of miracle, the travel was completed without a hitch. The entity had kept their hat low and their eyes stuck to the brim, which let them ensure that they would not meet anyone&rsquo;s gaze, whether voluntarily or otherwise.</p>
<p>Claire had at first planned to fill the twenty minutes with some small talk, whether genuine or faked; but her companion had looked so strained and focused that she had soon given up. Understanding and sharing their concern, she respected their choice and tried her best to not distract them; only wondering to herself why it was so hard for them to maintain a single appearance and why they wouldn&rsquo;t only ever transform by means of a conscious effort.</p>
<p>Surely, transforming had to consume some energy, which meant that this shifting transition mess occurring in-between two set forms was not their state of rest; so the reason why they could not stop these changes had to do with something else. It had to be their state of mind for the most part, and she hoped that there wasn&rsquo;t anything more to it than just that.<br>Hopefully, spending some time with her and Hershel and slowly getting accustomed to this new development would help them regain some confidence, and thus, self-control in that sense.</p>
<p>From then on, Claire only ever spoke to whisper the bare minimum of information, giving the shape-shifter basic directions and regularly letting them know how close they were to their destination. And so, for more than half of the duration of the trip overall, the&nbsp;only words that were uttered were <i>&ldquo;This is our stop.&rdquo;</i></p>

<div class=bar><span>September 28, 1953 &ndash; 14:02</span></div>
<p>Hershel Layton, newly appointed professor at Gressenheller University of London, and only person to ever get this position at the sweet young age of twenty-seven.<br>This would be quite the heavy title to bear; but through his hard work and dedication, he truly had earned it. In about just a week, he&nbsp;would be back in university; but this time, he would stand on the other side of the desk, and at the very bottom of the amphitheatre.</p><p>Now, this hat&hellip; He could not deny Claire&rsquo;s good taste, and he could not deny this hat&rsquo;s refinement and elegance. But he would like it far more, if only he could keep it stable on his head. This would require some taking used to.<br>Hopefully he would manage it by the time of the celebration they had planned for the evening, and not ridicule himself in front of his friends and mentor. Andrew would definitely make fun of him if, at any point, he found himself with an imperfectly vertical hat; and surely, with such preposterous height, even a tilt of a single degree would be noticeable.</p>
<p>The man was taken away from his thoughts and mirror when he heard knocks on his front door. He pondered many options as to who it could be while he ran to it, and soon found the need to catch the brim of his top hat as he once again felt it fall off in his precipitation; but out of all the hypotheses he had formulated, finding not one, but <i>two</i> Claires, was definitely not part of the list.</p>
<p>The Claire who wore the same attire as the one she had when leaving him an hour and a half ago looked at his dumbfounded face and instantly started laughing. With this laughter and the other aforementioned hint, this could only be the real one.<br>As for the other, the one who seemed quite stiff and silent and who would resolutely try to hide her entire body within her white straw hat if this could be in any shape or form physically possible&hellip;<br>Who could this possibly be?</p>
<p>The outgoing one placed her hands on her hips playfully and gave him a bright confident smile.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Hershel, have I ever told you that I have a sister?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>He blinked, taken aback. He only realized now that he had not even taken the time to make this deduction, which in retrospect should actually have been quite obvious and easy to make.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;No&hellip; I am quite sure that you never did.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The twins shared a look. The one in a blue jacket instantly came back to lowering her hat in order to cover her face, but he saw a very subtle nod of approval from her.<br>Claire crossed her arms, her smile unreadable.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Because I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Alright, she had lost him. Where did he last put his hint coins again?</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;But then, who&hellip;&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing.&rdquo; the non-Foley woman uttered in shame. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Hershel was, by all means, the most confused he ever remembered being in his entire life. Due to the lack of context and the seemingly absurd setting, he started wondering if, in some way, perhaps, he&nbsp;was dreaming. Perhaps the top hat also was part of the dream, because certainly, who in their right mind would have the idea to make a top hat <i>this</i> impractically tall?</p><p>Claire saw that the cogs of his brain were now turning in vain, and once again, she stiffled a short laugh.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;We can explain what really happened, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; she assured.</d></p>
<p>Taking a short pause though, she playfully bent down and to the side to emphasize that she was trying to look behind his back. Smiling with twice as much mischievousness, she added:</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;&hellip;If you let us in, that is.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The young professor jolted back to reality and realized his mistake; instantly freeing the passage with a large side step, he mindlessly gestured the ladies to enter.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I&mdash; my apologies. Of course.&rdquo; he mumbled awkwardly, still dumbstruck by the absurd situation.</d></p>
<p>The strange lady entered first with great precipitation; and once inside, she instantly let out a loud sigh of relief. As Claire followed and he closed the door behind him, he once again looked at the nameless woman, trying to decipher her every traits.<br>&hellip; Was it a trick of the light? It seemed like her hair had changed color, losing its ginger reflections in favor of a simple light brown.</p>
<p>Having noticed as well, Claire crossed her arms and jokingly stage whispered, actually ensuring that Hershel would also hear her words perfectly:</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Psst. Your disguise is falling apart again.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;W-what!?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>At the same time as this shriek, the one addressed jumped in surprise, and in the span of a single second, she had somehow gained more than three inches, traded her blue jacket for a longer dark brown one, and grown out of thin air an overly elevated top hat of the same color. The woman who no longer was one anymore, once back on the ground, completely froze and resolutely refused to turn back to face them.</p>
<p>Hershel stepped back precipitately, letting out a short but very meaningful yelp. Hardly recovering, his gaze instantly fell on his sweetheart, demanding an explanation.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I figured that there wouldn&rsquo;t be any way to possibly break it down to you slowly, so we might as well get it over with right from the start.&rdquo; Claire mused, now sporting a shameless devilish grin. Nudging his side with her elbow, she added: &ldquo;Besides, you&rsquo;re a fully fledged member of the screaming club, now. Congratulations.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;C-Claire, that&rsquo;s not funny!&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The stranger placated a hand against their mouth, realizing that the voice they had just spoken with had been just a little too revealing. And indeed, despite having turned their back to the couple, they very distinctly heard the young professor take another step back and gasp in shock. Ashamed, the impostor bit their lip and lowered the newly found top hat over their eyes; a top hat which Hershel only now recognized as being strangely identical to the one he had been fighting to keep on his head for the past hour and a half.</p>
<p>Claire walked to the anomaly who defied physics, and placed an apologetic hand on their shoulder. The two locked eyes, and without a word, the shape-shifter transformed back to mirror her&mdash; forgetting to change her outfit in the process. Hershel stared at one, then the other, back and forth; a cold shiver ran down his spine when he realized that he had found himself unable to spot any difference between the two.<br>As his mind couldn&rsquo;t help but imagine all sorts of nefarious plans that could emerge from this, he became all the more thankful that the imitation&rsquo;s attitude revealed their intentions clearly. This made it much easier to distinguish them from the original, and this comforted him in the idea that it was very much their wish as well to not be confused with the one they were copying.</p>
<p>The fake one weakly raised their hands to look at them, saw the sleeves of a lab coat, then lowered them and sighed. Now staring at the floor, they silently walked away to a corner of the living room, facing the wall and slowly attempting to go back to the altered outfit of an alleged twin sister that did not exist.</p>
<p>Hershel wanted to look away as their appearance once again started shifting, this time far more gradually and slowly; but the spectacle somehow found itself so bizarre, that it could only cause in him some sort of morbid curiosity.<br>Without a word, Claire went back to his side and looked at him straight in the eyes.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;As you can see, Hershel, we have here some sort of shape-shifter.&rdquo; she muttered, this time truly with the intent of being quiet. &ldquo;They say that they used to be human, and we don&rsquo;t know where they came from or how this happened&hellip; But the fact is that they cannot remember who they were. So far, they&rsquo;ve only been able to mimic other people.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;They do not have an identity of their own?&rdquo; he mused, unfortunately still a bit too shaken to remember to lower his voice.</d></p>
<p>The shape-shifter in question had walked back to face them, as they appeared to have completed their newest transformation; but despite having settled on an appearance that had been shown to somewhat last, they preferred maintaining their distance.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Trust me, I wouldn&rsquo;t copy anyone if I knew how to avoid it.&rdquo; they&nbsp;lamented, raising an ashamed face in their direction, staring at him directly with a shining, trembling pair of eyes. &ldquo;But I just&hellip; I just can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Hershel raised a hand to his chin by force of habit, but he was at a complete loss of words. He went through the entire scene once again, now with the answer to his puzzle in mind, and finally things seemed to make more sense&hellip; all the while raising twice as many questions as he had initially.<br>He exchanged a long stunned look with the stranger, and through the slightly altered face of his girlfriend, the stranger looked back with a hurricane of emotions. Soon, their hair seemed to gain some life of their own as they were raised in the air and changed color, and they yelped, instantly trying to cover the accident under the straw hat, instantly apologizing once the crisis under control.</p>
<p>The real Claire gave both a sad look, then invited them to sit&mdash; once again lightly putting a hand on the stranger&rsquo;s shoulder and gently pointing at the couch.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;This day is far from over, but it has been quite eventful already.&rdquo; she uttered. &ldquo;I&nbsp;will go make some tea, as I&rsquo;m sure we all need it.&rdquo;</d></p>
<hr class=bar><hr class=clock>
<p><d>&ldquo;How about &lsquo;Ashley&rsquo;, then? Ashley sounds nice.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The shape-shifter hummed and sighed, but once again, a few seconds of stroking their (Claire&rsquo;s) chin with a sad and lost look were enough for the woman to understand that this offer was not to their liking either.</p>
<p>As they had mentioned right from the start, the name &lsquo;Celeste&rsquo; was far from satisfying them, and they were very glad that they had not met the need to use it at all.<br>They were rather undecisive at the prospect of forging a new name from scratch, but since they couldn&rsquo;t find their own and probably would not be able to do so before a long while&hellip; At least being given the possibility to choose a temporary replacement was the best solution they had at their disposal.<br>In the same vein, they had also made it clear quite early that they would rather find an androgynous name; after all, they could not even remember their own gender.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Perhaps giving names at random would be inefficient by this point.&rdquo; Hershel mused, putting down his teacup and silently standing up. &ldquo;Let me see if I can find my dictionary.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The scientist lit up and congratulated him on his great idea, and she soon came to follow him. They searched around and through the man&rsquo;s shelves, and it took about two minutes before she would start teasing her boyfriend about his lack of organisational skills.</p>
<p>The entity remained seated on the couch, holding their warm cup within both hands, looking at the two with a timid, but happy smile. Just like Claire, the professor had not taken long at all to accept them, somehow; once the initial shock behind them and the soothing aroma of tea filling the room, almost all traces of tension or awkwardness had gradually faded away.<br>It surprised them immensely that they would be able to stare at such unbelievable situation right in the eyes and shrug it off so easily, and part of them almost wondered if they were merely pretending to be alright with it, if only partially so&hellip; But they certainly would not complain.</p>
<p>They still felt lost, and were almost ready to give up on the idea that they would ever gain any answers. And yet, sitting here in this charming little living room, looking at these two lovebirds who were such brilliant minds, yet all at the same time such sweet and naïve people who could not possibly imagine what catastrophe had almost separated them in the most tragic way possible&hellip;<br>They would never dare say that it made them feel at home; but&hellip; They felt welcome.</p>
<p>These two people, who they had just met, but who at the same time were not at all strangers to them&hellip; They truly made them feel like they belonged here.<br>It was not true, and they knew it far too well; but these two were quite talented at making them forget what little they knew, and believe otherwise.</p>
<p>As they finally got their hands on the long-awaited dictionary, the couple continued talking to each other fondly, now back to listing names and sharing their thoughts on each of them. By listening to their excitement, one could almost wonder if they had forgotten who they were supposed to name in the first place, and had instead started thinking of someone else entirely.</p>
<p>Without realizing it, the shape-shifter&rsquo;s mind had meanwhile started wandering around, taking a growing interest in their surroundings. Books were everywhere and in a bit of a mess, but the large windows let the sun shine through, shedding enough warm light in the room to compensate for it. Various artifacts from various eras and colors could be found here and there on the shelves, sometimes put on display, sometimes accidentally hidden between a few misplaced books.<br>This place felt cosy and welcoming; and more than just this, it felt personal and sincere. It was humble, pretentionless. All in all, it&nbsp;reflected the professor perfectly; and, if only in this very moment, they wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted it any other way.</p>
<p>Still in the midst of their lost and directionless thoughts, the entity found themselves by chance looking with particular interest at some pottery and short statuettes that the professor was keeping on the upper shelves.<br>One of them specifically had a rather funny face; somewhat distorted, either by the ravages of time or by the original clumsiness of the hands that crafted it; but still likeable in its awkwardness, if&nbsp;this could make any sense. They caught themselves smiling at it, as if it could somehow respond.</p><p>This craft was not particularly intricate, and neither did it look special in any way; and yet, they somehow found some form of familiarity while looking at it. This funny face, this material, this small and discreet form; among many things, it reminded them of the infinite malleability of&hellip;</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Clay.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Two interjections of slight surprise echoed in unison, as both scholars turned their heads back towards them.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Clay?&rdquo; Claire parroted, curious to hear them after their long absence. &ldquo;As in &lsquo;Clayton&rsquo;&hellip;?&rdquo; She turned to look at her boyfriend and laughed softly. &ldquo;That would be a little redundant.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p><d>&ldquo;No, just Clay.&rdquo; They stared down, frowning and pursing their lips with always that same expression of doubt and, in some way&hellip; resignation. &ldquo;I&nbsp;don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; they added, &ldquo;it just&hellip; It seems fitting.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The couple exchanged a silent look. Hershel stiffled a short breath as he turned back to them with a soft smile.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;Alright then.&rdquo; he concluded, nodding encouragingly. &ldquo;It is a pleasure to meet you, Clay.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The newly named entity gave him in return a shy, but warm smile. They jokingly brought a hand to their chest and bowed slightly.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;The pleasure&rsquo;s all mine, Professor.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s smile dropped all at once. Contrary to their intent, and to their great surprise, the reaction that their words had provoked in the abovementioned professor was one of complete shock&hellip; and of sudden suspicion.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;&hellip;Where did this come from?&rdquo; he asked, taken aback. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t even started teaching yet. And&hellip; How would you know about this anyway? Did Claire tell you?&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Unmoving, from the corner of her eyes, Claire sent a suddenly calculating look at the shape-shifter. There was not a single ounce of surprise in her gaze.</p>
<p><d>&ldquo;I was willing to wait a bit more and see if you would bring up the topic on your own,&rdquo; she justified calmly while shrugging lightly, &ldquo;but since we are here now&hellip; Would now be a good time to finally address how you already knew so much? About Hershel, about the hat&hellip; The list could go on.&rdquo;</d></p>
<p>Well. They should have known.<br>These two <i>had</i>, in fact, been intentionally keeping their questions to themselves in order to put them at ease and lower their guard; but not for a single moment had their mistakes escaped their attention.</p>

Clay narration, about how they lowered their guard only to strike right after having gained their trust.

&ldquo;I&hellip; It&rsquo;s quite&hellip; difficult to explain.&rdquo; they muttered in shame.

&ldquo;Please do try. After all, you do want us to help you remember your own past, don&rsquo;t you? In this case, sharing this kind of information with us is crucial.&rdquo; Hershel asserted in a tone which he wanted to keep encouraging, but which also hinted at some traces of sternness and suspicion. &ldquo;&hellip;Unless your amnesia isn&rsquo;t as severe as you make it out to be?&rdquo;




&ldquo;Claire, do you&hellip;&rdquo; Stopping mid-sentence, they once again bit their lip tensely. &ldquo;If I were to say that I&hellip; that I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be here. That if things had gone the way I know them, I&hellip; I hadn&rsquo;t showed up in your lab. What do you think would have happened?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Dimitri made it quite clear, I think. And&hellip; He was right. If you had gone through with the experiment&hellip; You wouldn&rsquo;t have made it out alive.&rdquo;

&ldquo;How could you possibly know what would have happened, since it didn&rsquo;t&hellip;?&rdquo;
Claire shuddered; looked at Clay straight in the eyes; they sent her back the very same, knowing look. Not a word had been exchanged, but it was clear that they both

&ldquo;You&hellip; traveled through time? Until here?&rdquo; the scientist asked, her face losing what little color it normally had. &ldquo;And you <i>changed</i> your own past!?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not on purpose! I don&rsquo;t even know how I made it here!&rdquo; &ldquo;But, well, now that it&rsquo;s <i>already done</i>&hellip; I don&rsquo;t regret a second of it. The way things turned out was in every way an improvement, I&rsquo;d say. Only downside would be me, I guess.&rdquo;






Clay says that they knew Layton from the future and was part of his team (forced to say it when Layton mused how many details they seemed to know about him personally). Layton says that the name &ldquo;Sycamore&ldquo; slightly rings a bell, but that he needs more info so as to know where to find him.

<!-- Clay says something about wishing that they could introduce themselves with their true name, but that they're glad to at least have one in the meantime. Layton stops to think for a bit, then...
Layton will be the first to think about Clay&rsquo;s fingerprints as a possible clue to their identity.
"In fact, if you may&hellip; I might have a theory that would need testing."

Without a word, Hershel came to his desk, searched a bit, then pulled out an ink (tampon pour mettre la date), a handkerchief, and three sheets of paper. Setting an example, he instantly dripped his fingers in the ink before pressing each finger on one of the sheets.
He handed out the ink and the two remaining sheets to them, and they complied dutifully, only borrowing the handkerchief at the end to clean off their hands.
With all three sheets of paper now filled with ten ink blots each, three heads went to hover the table in dread.
All three sets were completely different. Hershel sighed in relief, and gave a confident smile.

Clay&rsquo;s fingerprints might have been altered without them realizing it during any of their transformations, but it is only a question of "might"; despite Clay&rsquo;s great sense of observation and 3D visualization of people, reproducing fingerprints exactly was never on their mind. And indeed, right at first glance, their and Claire&rsquo;s fingerprints look nothing alike.
"As perfect as your imitations will appear to the naked eye, it is still a disguise in the end. Whether made willingly or subconsciously, it is most likely impossible to be precise to such extent."

"You transformed into both of us, but your fingerprints don&rsquo;t match either; and they do not look like a combination of our fingerprints either."
"It might be a little too optimistic to say that they were never altered at all during any of your transformations&hellip; But I would say that there is a very high likelihood that these fingerprints are for the most part still yours; and yours alone."
Claire clasped her hands in joy, her smile now hanging from ear to ear.
"So we <i>do</i> have something tangible now!"
"It isn&rsquo;t much," the man muttered apologetically, "but it is a start. This is something to go off of. And&hellip;" He trailed off, looking in silence at the third person in the room with a soft gaze. Lowering his voice, he continued: "I believe that this is something they needed to hear."
Their hand trembling, the shape-shifter shyly reached out for the sheet which had been imprinted with the last remaining proof of their identity. The paper shook as they held it beneath their gaze, but they managed to carefully and neatly (plier) it, albeit with great difficulty. They brought it to their chest, holding it tightly.
In the softest, barely audible voice, the amnesiac stranger breathed some most sincere words:
"Thank you. Thank you so much." -->
