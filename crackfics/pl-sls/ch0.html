<p class=em>There were many reasons behind Bill Hawks&rsquo; presence on this precise day, at this precise hour, about to change History in what could be the most literal sense possible.</p><v></v>
<p>His gaze determined and veiled by nothing but his squared glasses, he had little care for his surroundings. The taste for theatrics was still quite far from him, and so he gave not a single thought to the yellowing walls, to the scrawny furniture full to their breaking point, to the dilapidated plumbing forever waiting for financing that would never come, to the tall windows at the back of the room, aligned like electric poles waiting for the storm. He had been standing in their presence during long hours, on every working day, and never had he particularly taken a liking to them.</p><v></v>
<p>No, truly, space hardly meant anything to him; only time mattered, as much as it was limited. His associate, the shy and dreamy Dimitri Allen, was on his last day of vacation, as he had preferred resting for one more day: well, too bad for him and his lacking zeal. That will make more room on the Nobel prize podium, he thought. He would already have to tolerate the shadow cast by his assistant&rsquo;s inevitable glory: everybody remembers the renowned fool in that snowman costume and his legendary steps on the Moon<!--¬π-->, but who will remember the one who sent him up there in the first place?</p><v></v>
<p>Ah, enough slander, he was being dishonest. After all, Dimitri Allen and Claire Foley were two perfect colleagues, both brilliant and passionate physicians, and even though he was their senior in both age and career, he owed a lot to them both. So many years of hard work, of dead ends, of discoveries, of false hopes, and, finally, of tangible results&hellip; Here was what all of this had been leading to.</p><v></v>
<p>Bill had little care for the place in which he was standing, little care for the university&rsquo;s administrative farandole, little care for this cramped office; but he had to admit that one thing in this room was still worth seeing. This immense clock and its golden hues <i>&mdash;this is actually just brass, don&rsquo;t pay too much attention to the brown traces in the corners, we all know how the budget works&mdash;</i> was towering some sort of reddish cooker, itself surrounded by metal pipes of all widths and colors.</p>
<p>All along, he had been dearly attached to the policy of keeping their project&rsquo;s design, especially a <i>prototype</i>, as plain and limited to the strictly necessary as possible; yet, in this specific moment, while he was just about to run it for the first time with an actual passenger on board&hellip; Part of him thanked Claire for her usual extravagance: because this clock, with its gigantic, uselessly well crafted hands, whose only purpose was to stand there for show and only remind everyone of what their research was about, was, in the end, he had to admit, quite magnificent and, most importantly, photogenic. It would be perfect for the headlines.</p><v></v>
<p>Before he could freely think about the press, however&hellip; An experiment had first to prove its worth. All in good time.</p>
<p>As he tried to pull himself together, surprisingly, he found the need to subtly loosen the knot of his tie so he could catch his breath.</p><v></v>
<p>For the first, and perhaps the last time in his life, the short research director and his lab coat could experience this ever so rare sense of nausea: the one that comes neither from sickness nor from anticipation per se; but rather the one that falls from a sudden and poignant realization. The one that made him remember how crucial the next few moments would be; the one that made him collapse from the sheer weight of the power he had in his hands; the one that charmed him with the intoxicating knowledge that in this very moment, he was the one in control of not just his own destiny, but that of many others.</p><v></v>
<p>There were, once again, many reasons for him to be right there, right then.</p><v></v><p>Progress was one of them; the one he wished to keep upfront, and the only one he wished others to see.</p><v></v><p>Ambition was another; the one he would try to justify as a good reason, as long as it remained the means to an end, rather than an end all by itself.</p><v></v><p>And then, greed&hellip; The one he pretended did not exist.</p>

<!-- <wip><p>¬π Il sera de votre choix de consid√©rer ou non ceci comme un anachronisme ; mais √©tant donn√© que Bill Hawks y fait d√©j√† r√©f√©rence au d√©but du troisi√®me jeu (qui a lieu aux alentours de janvier 1964), soit avec cinq ans d‚Äôavance, j‚Äôai pr√©f√©r√© consid√©rer par commodit√© que dans l‚Äôunivers du professeur Layton, l‚Äôhumanit√© a √©t√© un petit peu plus pr√©coce. D‚Äôune certaine mani√®re, ce ne serait pas du tout surprenant, au vu de ce monde rempli de l‚Äôesth√©tique aux airs steampunk, et des machines farfelues que l‚Äôon peut r√©guli√®rement y trouver.

Oh, au passage, les jeux ont toujours essay√© de demeurer aussi obscurs que possible quant √† la p√©riode √† laquelle ils se d√©roulent, justement pour ne pas avoir √† se limiter dans l‚Äôimagination de machines toutes plus improbables les unes que les autres. Cependant, les d√©veloppeurs ont volontiers admis qu‚Äôils avaient pris comme source d‚Äôinspiration le Londres des ann√©es 1960 ; et de plus, l‚Äôexistence d‚Äôune certaine pi√®ce √† conviction (une image datant de 2008 qui est encore pr√©sente sur le site japonais officiel) a pu prouver de mani√®re ‚Äúofficieuse‚Äù que ledit jeu se d√©roulerait bien en 1964. J‚Äôai ajout√© ‚Äújanvier‚Äù arbitrairement au vu de la neige qui tombe, du fait qu‚Äôil est plus logique de placer les premier et deuxi√®me jeux durant l‚Äô√©t√© 1963 plut√¥t que 1964 (car ladite image oscille entre les chiffres 3 et 4, plut√¥t que 4 et 5 ‚Äî indiquant a priori que PL3 aurait quitt√© 1963 r√©cemment, plut√¥t que d‚Äô√™tre sur le point de passer en 1965), et que ces trois jeux se d√©roulent dans l‚Äôespace de moins d‚Äôun an.

Cette fanfiction prend donc place un peu plus de dix ans auparavant, conform√©ment √† la chronologie de cette s√©rie.
