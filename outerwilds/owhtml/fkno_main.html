<div class=chp><h1>Worldbuilding notes</h1><ul>
    <li>All durations and distances are <orng><b>multiplied by 10</b></orng> compared to their in-game values (…with, admittedly, some level of leniency and me pretending that the rocket science still makes any sense). In human units, the time loop lasts <orng><b>3h 48min 10s</b></orng>, with the notable detail that the OPC takes around one minute and a half to reorient itself into a different position before it fires, and that similarly people who are paired with statues need some time to process the memories being sent to them before they can be operational again.</li>
    <li>Any location on Timber Hearth sees a sunrise every <orng><b>1h 9min 20s</b></orng>. Additionally, a full rotation of Timber Hearth around the sun (what we would normally call a ‘year’) lasts only <orng><b>41min 43s</b></orng>, which is even shorter. Because of this, Hearthians will not associate the words ‘year’ or ‘day’ and ‘night’ to these natural phenomena, but to more artificial constructs.</li>
    <li>The periodicity of the Hearthian calendar is based not only on the position of the sun in the Hearthian sky, but also of the Attlerock’s. Indeed, a solar eclipse occurs every <orng><b>29min 18s</b></orng> on average, and the time at which the eclipse occurs relative to the village’s sky can be used as a marker of time with some level of periodicity. The longest cycle which can be constructed directly from this is the <b>perfect eclipse sunrise</b> (during which the Attlerock and sun rise in the sky at the same time as an eclipse), which occurs almost every 15 human days (14 days and 21h to be precise).</li>
    <li>Every Hearthian ‘week’ starts with an eclipse sunrise. A week contains 309 day/night cycles (referred to as ‘sunrises’ for convenience), split into 14 Hearthian days with one extra sunrise at the end.</li>
    <li>A Hearthian ‘day’ (our equivalent to a 24h ‘day’) is made of 52 eclipses and <orng><b>22 day/night cycles</b></orng>, of which, on average, 11 are dedicated to sleep and 11 to waking hours. Hatchlings sleep the most, while adults will tend to be active for longer in order to help the community. In human units, such a day lasts 25h 22min 44s.</li>
    <li>The time loop occurs between the 113th and 117th sunrises of the week (written respectively as 113s and 117s), which correspond to the waking sunrise cycles within the sixth day of the week. If I were to roughly translate that into some sort of human calendar by squishing the timing into a 24h clock, the loop would start around “9:45AM” and end at roughly “1PM.”</li>

<div class=chp id=ch0><h1>Prologue</h1><h2>Attempt #459</h2><hr>
<p>The first thing Firn saw upon waking up was a strange flash of light coming from Giant’s Deep.</p>
<p class=vs>The second thing Firn saw as they sat up and yawned quietly was Slate, tending to the campfire and evidently planning to soon roast some marshmallows. They decided to join in, happily reaching out for their stick as the realization of just which day this was drew in.</p>
<p>It was finally their very own launch day! They were excited beyond reason, and impatient to finally board their very own ship… albeit not enough to skip breakfast. Just one last treat or two before blasting off into space would never hurt anyone, and in fact, the delay it gave them was far more merciful to the survival of their entire world than they could have ever imagined.</p>
<p>After spending a few minutes stuffing their mouth with golden delicacies and exchanging with the Hearthian on the other side of the fire some casual banter sprinkled with the occasional sarcastic joke, the third thing Firn saw was Hal jumping off the steep descent all the way down from the observatory and straight in their direction, wearing ample white clothing and holding something that looked like a helmet under their arm. Wait— was that the <span class=scaps>eva</span> from the zero-g cave?</p>
<p>Before they knew it, Hal was right by their side and fiercely grabbing their arm, pulling up.</p>
<p>“Morning sleepyhead,” they said absent-mindedly with little to no true meaning or intent behind their words, “sorry for the rough start but we’re a bit strapped for time here.”</p>
<p>“H-<span class=scaps>h</span>al? Wha–Why–How’d you get here!?”</p>
<p class=vs>Firn had so many questions, but only one of them could physically escape their lips in an intelligible manner. Truth be told, they were so confused, and just not quite completely aware enough yet, that they themselves were not really sure which one out of their already humongous and yet continuously growing pile they had managed to phrase in its entirety, or even if a single one of them had been at all.</p>
<p>As they were dragged to the lift platform, they barely had a split second to share a distressed look with a Slate who, mouth gaping wide enough to hypothetically fit at least a dozen uncooked marshmallows simultaneously, was equally too shocked to speak coherently. By the time the next fleeting moment flew by, the shipwright’s face had already disappeared from even their upper eyes’ peripheral vision.</p>
<p>“Hal, what on <i>Hearth</i> is going on!?” they finally asked the moment they found the ability to align words in a proper order, stressing each one of them with a waning confusion which was slowly growing instead into stern annoyance.</p>
<p>“Time loop,” Hal swiftly responded with practiced efficiency, while their fingers pressed in a blur the button sequence separating them from the brand new ship which had all at the same time never launched before, and yet already travelled through the entire solar system. “We’ve been through this before, you just don’t remember it.”</p>
<p>“What? Wait, how’d you know the launch codes—”</p>
<p>“<i>Time loop</i>, Firn.” The elevator stopped with a thud, and Hal immediately resumed their quick pace, completely ignoring Slate’s confused cries resonating from below. “We have barely three sunrises before the sun explodes.”</p>
<p>“Before the sun <i class=scaps>what!?</i>” Instead of an answer, Firn was unceremoniously jostled into their very own ship, losing their balance upon landing on the gravity crystal-powered floor.</p>
<p>“Heard me the first time.” Hal instantly broke their fall with a swift catch under their arms, as if even the way they were about to collapse had been meticulously calculated and practiced countless times, and they gently but firmly guided them to face a specific wall inside their ship.</p>
<p>Firn, having barely recovered their senses enough to question what a ‘time loop’ was even supposed to be and how nonsensical it should be as a concept if one were to dare pull it out of the realm of fiction, nonetheless followed their friend’s finger pointing at something close, and looked down as they saw the Outer Wilds Ventures insignia flicker into something new.</p>
<p>Their jaw dropped.</p>

<!-- @SFOLD — 001 — CHAP. 1:  Launch Day -->
<div id=loop1></div>
<div class=chp id=ch1_1><h1>Chapter 1</h1><h2>Launch Day</h2><hr>
<p class=vs>It was the third sunrise of the day when Hal was pulled out of their sleep. Letting a grunt fester and die in their throat, their first conscious thought was to make a mental note to themself that they would have to remind Marl to close the blinds before they left the cabin for their daily attempt at sneaking past Rutile and Moraine and try to get a hit or two against <i>that tree</i>.</p>
<p class=vs>Granted, it was an immutable fact that Timber Hearth’s rotation (alongside every type of rotation of every astral body in their solar system, really) was objectively forcing upon them a sunrise every sixty minutes; but it also was an immutable fact that, in spite of the too rapid celestial dance of the star they were orbiting, there surely had to be a <i>reason</i> why their ancestors had evolved to require a minimum of six or seven sunrises of good sleep in a row.</p><p>Some had even theorized that this reason might be related to the fact that this amount of time was the average required in order to maintain the level of intelligence that their species had managed to reach, and Firn had… perhaps, sometimes, unkindly made sarcastic barbs about Marl and waking up early when they too were paying the price of the lumberjack’s disregard for others’ sleeping schedules.</p>
<p>Oh well. They were up now, four eyes bathing in undesired sunlight, and they might as well make some use of these unexpected extra forty minutes or so that the sun had so graciously forced into their hands.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal was almost surprised to not hear Firn complain about the blinds being left open as well, but then they remembered: this night, their cabin had sheltered one less Hearthian than usual.</p>
<p>Today was Firn’s launch day. How could they forget that this was the day their best friend would finally fulfill their lifelong dream?</p>
<p>Hal wondered whether they had a good night. Sleeping under the stars surely wasn’t by a long shot the most comfortable way to have a good rest, for more reasons than one. The founders of Outer Wilds Ventures and Firn themself said that it was a tradition, but they wondered whether it was a good tradition to have their astronauts depart in a state when they were bound to be in less than optimal shape.</p>
<p>They remembered Firn’s first attempt at using a jetpack. They tried not to think about Firn’s ship crashing the same way, but with even more power and momentum. Their attempt was unsuccessful.</p>
<p class=vs>…No, they needed to have more faith in them. Firn <i>had</i> passed the tests, they <i>had</i> convinced Gossan that they were ready, Gossan had even come to tell them in person that Firn was ready and that there was no need to make themself needlessly nauseous with worry about it, and among the founders, Gossan was the biggest stickler for safety.</p>
<p>Firn was going to be <i>fine</i>.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But what if they <i>weren’t?</i></p>
<hr>
<p>About twelve minutes past the sunrise, and Hal was stepping outside, taking in the scent of pine trees and the sight of a village much calmer than they were used to.</p>
<p class=vs>Part of them considered seeing for themself how Firn was doing, but they instantly reconsidered. They knew they would come to bid their goodbyes once they were ready, and from what Hal had been told, Firn would have to traverse the crater and visit Hornfels before their departure. Under these circumstances, making their way to the observatory and waiting for them up there thus sounded like the most convenient plan.</p>
<p>That being said, it wasn’t long before their train of thought had to be interrupted.</p>
<p>“If it isn’t the little Hal!” Gneiss called out with a smile. “Out early today?”</p>
<p>The hatchling rolled their eyes. “Marl forgot to close the blinds. Again. I just thought I’d try getting out of bed, for a change.” A nervous flick of their ears punctuated their frown as they soon added: “Also, I’m not <i>little</i>–”</p>
<p>Gneiss gave a soft, warm laugh. “Well, maybe some day you and Firn will finally adapt to waking up at adult times, and I’ll then start considering you like one. Any elder will tell you that the village needs more hands, and the earlier they are fresh and ready to get the job done, the better.”</p>
<p class=vs>Hal hummed, looking down. Both Firn and they were now considered in age to drink sap wine, even though they had only grown enough to stomach it four weeks ago (and even though, out of the two, either Firn was still struggling with digesting it, or they simply hated the taste). However, with this ritual of adulthood came not just the slow and progressive shedding of a nickname, but also new responsibilities in regards to sustaining the village’s comfort and lifestyle. And as much as they wanted to contribute, Hal was not quite certain how ready for it they were just yet.</p>
<p>They had the Nomai and their many years of hard work poured into deciphering their language, and they would gladly continue doing so their entire life if they could; this was the sort of path that someone like Riebeck had chosen, in a way. But… aside from giving Slate some extremely vague hints about the purpose of this or that rock and then seeing them recycle eons old debris into exploding contraptions, their research simply did not… <i>feel</i> directly useful or special. Not when their village had so many mouths to feed, and not enough hands to gather the food.</p>
<p>And so, albeit reluctantly, Hal wanted to be a part of the village proper. It was not so much about making a difference… More so about simply looking out for each other, and showing their care for the crater as a whole. It was a sense of duty. Gabbro went to space, Riebeck went to space, Firn was about to go to space… <i>Someone</i> needed to stay down here and keep the village alive, even if it meant that they could not afford to spend all of their waking sunrises figuring out more about the Nomai. It wasn’t like they even cared about space, anyway.</p>
<p>“Speaking of, while you’re here,” Gneiss continued, and Hal startled as they wondered whether they might have been dozing off, “I’ve seen you having fun with your whittling lately, and I thought I might ask for your help with a little something.”</p>
<p>Hal blinked, ears perking up. “Oh, of course,” they nodded reflexively.</p>
<p>“Agreeing before I even told you what it was?” the elder chuckled, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>They shrugged, also smiling along. “I mean, if you ask for my help, I guess it’s going to be something I <i>can</i> do, right? And aside from waiting for the next sunrise, well…”</p>
<p>There came another deep and warm chuckle. “You are such a sweet one. Firn should have tried to learn a little bit of that from you.”</p>
<p>“F-<span class=scaps>f</span>irn can be nice,” Hal retorted defensively as they followed the elder inside their cabin and to the workshop. “They’re just… blunt.”</p>
<hr>
<p class=vs>Gneiss had been working on a new fishing rod. As it turned out, Spinel’s last big catch had done quite a number on their favorite one, and despite the fact that they did have spares, it was undeniable that their efficiency had been lacking during the past few days.</p>
<p>Hal had only been enlisted for the finishing, most delicate touches; with the elder sitting by their side and blowing on the last spots of fresh varnish which still remained on the head of their latest unfinished instrument, the sunrise flew by and sunset came without either of them noticing.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal did not mind. This was by no means an activity they would call nearly as enthralling as diving their head in copies and photos of Nomai writings and trying to make any kind of sense from it all, but this was calming; stimulating enough that they would feel engaged in their work, easy and repetitive enough that they could let their mind wander without causing any mistakes. It was… pleasant enough. And the result was going to be useful, so hey, that part felt good.</p>
<p>And, well, anyway, they knew that nothing in their entire life would ever top the sheer excitement and joy that they had experienced during those long, yet far too short months spent on building the translator with their best friend. They already knew that the happiest days of their life were now likely behind them.</p>
<p>They heaved another sigh. <i>Stars</i>, they would miss them.</p>
<p>…Their mind wandered back to reality when they found Gneiss’ hand coming to them and asking for the fishing rod. Apparently, they had judged that they were done adjusting the guide rings…? Hal was not sure they were attached quite well enough, but with a shrug, they hesitantly complied.</p>
<p>“Your help truly is appreciated,” the elder hummed with a soft smile, putting the nearly-but-not-quite finished banjo away. As they did so, they gave a melancholic sigh to a different incomplete craft of theirs, which had been sitting in the same shadowed corner of their workshop for the past few days. “Alas, I was hoping to finish Firn’s instrument before their launch, but I was caught by all those impromptu delays.”</p>
<p>Hal looked down. “Sorry, if I’d known, I would’ve—”</p>
<p>Gneiss exploded in gentle laughter. “Hatchling, I just <i>thanked</i> you for your help! Whatever do you feel the need to <i>apologize</i> for?”</p>
<p>Hal stifled a laugh as well, only letting one short breath come out of their nose as a shy smile took shape in the corner of their lips. “Just a force of habit,” they shrugged.</p>
<p>Gneiss shook their head, looking up at the ceiling with a caring but exasperated sigh. They soon turned their four tired eyes to the hatchling’s work, studying the details of the carving and mounting alike, and smiling with pride while they tested the tool’s durability.</p>
<p>“I know you are far more interested in diving your head in books that were written before our species was even born,” (Hal decided against telling them that, as far as they and everyone else knew, the Nomai didn’t <i>have</i> books per se, just weird magical stones with information somehow directly imprinted into them), “but I’ve seen how delicate you are with your own crafts.”</p>
<p>Hal frowned upon seeing that the elder was no longer looking at them or the fishing rod, and frowned deeper when they followed their gaze and realized what their attention had turned to instead. Their ears gained some light shades of purple as they opened their satchel and took out their latest work in progress… one which, well, they had barely gotten started on the day before, during their last sunrise before sleep.</p>
<p>“What, this? It’s just a stick I picked up and started carving when I was bored.” It did not even look like anything yet, just like a stick with a barely pointed end. It could just as well be used as a bland stake to pitch a tent or grill a fish.</p>
<p>Gneiss stifled a laugh, deciding against pointing out all the other far more elaborate sculptures they had seen in their hands during the past few weeks, and which they were certain were hiding inside this very same satchel in this very moment.</p>
<p>“And the care you put into it would go quite well into helping the village with shiny new tools, if you wanted me to teach you the ropes. My hands aren’t as steady as they used to be, you know, so your talent truly could be put to good use.”</p>
<p>“Heh, thanks… I guess. All of them still need a lot more work, though–”</p>
<p>“Balderdash,” the elder huffed softly, “you worry too much. You’ve got a whole life ahead of you to keep learning.”</p>
<p>“And they’re not particularly useful for the village, they’re just little unfinished trinkets to keep my hands busy—”</p>
<p>“<i>Come now</i>, hatchling,” Gneiss scolded, “you know that isn’t true. You think my instruments are any more useful to the village?”</p>
<p>“At least your instruments bring everyone together during the campfires,” Hal shrugged.</p>
<p>The elder’s gaze deflated in patient and quiet exasperation. “<span class=grey><i>Sigh…</i></span> Whatever are we going to do with you if you keep putting yourself down like that? It’s like if you’re ruining your self-confidence on purpose.”</p>
<p class=vs>Everybody knew Hal could do a lot of great things, with some more polishing that would naturally come with gaining the experience of age. Everybody, except the Hearthian themself.</p>
<p>And for this, Gneiss decided to stop fooling around. “Just show me one of these from up close. If you want criticism this badly, I’ll tell you how much better than you think they truly are. I know you’ve got a couple on hand.”</p>
<p>Ears dropping, Hal took a shy step back. “B-but…”</p>
<p>“Don’t make me pull them out of your bag myself, <i>hatchling</i>,” the instrument maker threatened with a heavy and deliberate emphasis on the infantilizing designation, and Hal cowered a little more with a tiny, barely audible yelp. Those eyes did not look like they were bluffing.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, the young Hearthian opened their satchel again, searching for the least ugly one they could find, and cringing at the sight. Who were they kidding, they were <i>all</i> ugly, the anatomy was all wrong and they could never get the neck right.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, Gneiss did not seem to give a single care in the world for that. “You have quite the wild imagination,” they chuckled softly as they let the wood shine under the sunlight phasing through the pine trees. “I’ve seen you carve quite a lot of these lately.”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah, that was when Gabbro came back with a new finding, a few weeks ago… It was a statue– a <i>complete</i>, intact statue!”</p>
<p>The elder hummed. “A statue made by those… kodai, was it?”</p>
<p>“Nomai,” Hal corrected with a sheepish smile. “I just… all my life, I’ve been trying to imagine what they could <i>look</i> like, and then they made <i>that</i> huge discovery. It just makes me wish even more that I could see a real, live one, but… Well, th-that’s just wishful thinking.”</p>
<p>Seeing their fiddling hands and nervous twitching, Gneiss finally caved in and handed them the little sculpture back. Hal, blushing even more than before, seized it hurriedly and buried it back where it had come from with both haste and, somehow, still delicate care to ensure that it would not be damaged in the process.</p>
<p>“Hornfels told me yesterday that they were almost done prepping it for display,” Hal mumbled. “The– the <i>statue</i>, I mean. Should’ve said that first. Uh, I mean, m-maybe they need help with the final touches, or…” Or maybe they were already done with it by now, it was likely even, but they were not going to mention this out loud when they had finally found a way out.</p>
<p>The elder nodded with a tired chuckle, catching on their attempt at a cop out and choosing to play along. “Well, in that case I won’t hold you back any longer. You can send them my regards.”</p>
<p>With a sheepish and strained nod, the young Hearthian twiddled with the latch of their satchel and turned around mechanically, before trotting away.</p>
<p class=vs>Gneiss sighed. They would come around eventually, they told themself. They had a lot of potential, if only they could be convinced of it and accept that <i>potential</i> did not mean instant perfection. One day, they would realize that experience did not have to be gained instantly and that the only expectations they were currently disappointing were their own.</p>
<p>Hopefully.</p>
<hr>
<p>It was already well past sunset when Hal started climbing up the stairs to the observatory, and they were half cursing the elder for having taken so much of their time giving unwanted attention to their unfinished meaningless works, half berating themself for being rude about it when Gneiss had, all in all, been nothing but nice to them. Mostly.</p>
<p>As they reached the fenced patch of ghost matter and looked to the left, their ears perked up in surprise. If there was one Hearthian they had not expected to see at such high altitude, it would be none other than their older cabinmate.</p>
<p>“Marl?” they called out. “What are you doing up here?”</p>
<p>The swing of an ax was swiftly interrupted, ending craftily hidden behind the lumberjack’s back instead of between two grooves on the trunk. “Oh– Hey, Hal, good morning. Early riser much, today?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, all thanks to you,” they replied with a huff, rolling their eyes. “You forgot the blinds again.”</p>
<p>The taller Hearthian blinked in surprise. Then they brought a hand to their neck, pursing their lips. “Ooh… yeah. My bad.” They paused for a second, then tried to save face: “But you <i>know</i> I have to raise them during the night! Can’t look outside and make sure the road is clear if they’re in the way.”</p>
<p class=vs>Deciding that they would ignore any and all discussions about their increasingly convoluted schemes, Hal squinted, studying the shape of the wood from afar despite the low visibility. They only saw one or two haphazard marks, not nearly deep enough to cause any trouble, perhaps even shallow enough to avoid being noticed. Good.</p>
<p>It was in fact rather intriguing, just how little damage was made. Either Marl had been surprisingly holding back (unlikely), or this specific tree truly was noticeably sturdier than any other (much more likely). Maybe the tree did hold a grudge just as much as Marl did, somehow.</p>
<p>Hal internally snickered at the thought. As if a <i>tree</i> could maintain a feud. “And has it ever occurred to you to just… You know, let it go? Cutting down that tree will cause far more harm than good. You know Rutile means it when they try to tell you that.”</p>
<p>“And Rutile only says that because they can’t stand change. They can’t imagine how good a big tree-less crater would be! Less shade, more sun, a lot more wood. What’s not to love about that?”</p>
<p class=vs>Unfortunately for their ears and sanity, Hal had long given up on trying to bring up the argument that cutting down such a large tree was bound to cause a lot of panic and destruction once its massive trunk would fall upon at least a good half of the village’s cabins.</p>
<p>It did not mean that Marl had failed to notice that the thought had again crossed their mind and simply refused to leave their lips, though.</p>
<p>“I know what you’re thinking,” they mumbled, “and you know what? That’s the <i>point</i>. You do realize that this tree keeps growing, right? Each day that passes, it becomes an even bigger hazard. I’d be doing everyone a <i>favor</i> by getting rid of it as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“Go tell that to Rutile,” Hal sighed while rubbing their lower eyes and glaring with the other pair. “I’m not getting involved in this.”</p>
<p class=vs>“I gave the whole thing some <i>thought</i>, you know,” Marl continued anyway. “You all make a fair point about it being dangerous to try getting rid of the whole tree at once. <i>Buuut</i>, have you considered the alternative? What if I got rid of it <i>little by little</i>, starting from the top.” The ax came out of their back and was sent straight into the tree, accompanied with a grunting <i>oomph</i>; if this newest attempt had left a dent on its surface, Hal failed to find it.</p>
<p>Then, turning once again to their cabinmate as they readied another swing, they concluded with a proud grin: “Sounds much safer now, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>Hal deadpanned. “Marl. Go home before I send Moraine after you.”</p>
<p>The lumberjack pouted, but begrudgingly retracted the ax from the trunk and attached it to their belt before they crossed their arms. Walking away, they grumbled something about <i>thinking that they’d said they wouldn’t get involved</i> and that <i>they were no fun</i>.</p>
<p>“And don’t forget the <i>blinds</i>, next time!” Hal warned with a hand curled up around their mouth to let the sound of their voice reach its target.</p>
<p>As they watched them stomp their way down the mountain road and back to the village below, Hal’s ears caught the sound of laughter coming from behind.</p>
<p>“They’ll never change, will they?”</p>
<p>Hal looked up the path they had intended to take up to the observatory, and found that Gossan was currently walking down from it, having likely witnessed the scene from afar on their way. The flight coach sent them a friendly wave right after their quip, and with a small tired smile, Hal waved back.</p>
<p>“Never mind them,” the hatchling sighed. “You know they’ll be right back at it before the next sunrise.”</p>
<p>There was another amused chuckle as the elder crossed their arms and looked down; but soon, they turned their attention back to the Hearthian next to them, and studied them up and down. “So, today’s the day, huh?” they started as a non-sequitur, yet fully expecting Hal to know exactly what they were talking about. “Not too nervous?”</p>
<p>Hal did not need any reminder as they grew a worried smile. “W-well, I’m not the one going in space,” they shrugged awkwardly. They could not prevent a hand from trying to rub away the tension in their neck, and Gossan’s gaze softened upon noticing.</p>
<p>“Don’t you worry, Hal. I told you countless times, Firn is ready.”</p>
<p>They closed their eyes and heaved a long, pained breath which might as well have been a muffled scream. “<i>I know</i>. But still, I just can’t stop imagining all kinds of things that could happen to them, and they have a tendency to be <i>careless</i>, and…”</p>
<p>Gossan let them trail off in silence, lost in thought. After a short moment, they closed their eyes as well, head lowering ever so slightly. “Just like our first astronaut was,” they said with solemnity and a distinct restraint in the display of their emotions.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal gave these words all they could, in the form of a respectful moment of silence.</p>
<p>It was not a warning; it was not a wish, nor a wish that things could be different. It was simply a statement.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the sky, in the perfect silence brought by the distance and emptiness, an explosion occurred. Neither Hearthian took notice.</p>
<p>“I don’t want Firn to…” Hal caught themselves and bit their lip before they could finish that train of thought. “Sorry. I shouldn’t be saying that.”</p>
<p>The flight coach regained their smile, bittersweet. “You are a great friend, Hal. Firn will miss you as much as you’ll miss them. It’s just that… Well. You know where their eyes have always been.” Their head turned upwards, watching as Giant’s Deep was slowly leaving the zenith.</p>
<p>Hal nodded sadly, following the founder’s gaze. “The stars.”</p>
<p>“Just like Feldspar,” Gossan sighed with the same expression, of both regret and longing. “You just couldn’t keep either of them on this rock for long. Their dreams belong out there, and they’ll never stop chasing them.”</p>
<p>Silence fell again, as for a few moments, the conversation was only being maintained by the hiding crickets. The night sky was pretty.</p>
<p>A deep breath. “I made them promise they wouldn’t be trying any crazy stunts,” Hal mumbled.</p>
<p>Gossan laughed softly. “Then that’s one more reason I trust they won’t, not unless their life depended on it,” they assured– only to notice that the second part of their sentence made the hatchling’s ears flicker in fear. “…By which I mean they are going to be <i>cautious</i> on their first launch, Hal. It’s not as if they were going to try landing on that contraption orbiting the sun. Their first destination is going to be a safe one.”</p>
<p>With yet another sigh, they nodded in silence; convinced, yet not at all reassured.</p>
<p>“Tell you what,” Gossan chuckled again with more enthusiasm, “Tektite told me yesterday that a piece of mining equipment broke in the zero-g cave. I was considering asking Firn to take care of it, as a last-minute refresher. Should convince you that <i>even</i> if they ever get their ship in trouble, they’ll know how to handle it just fine.”</p>
<p>All of the hatchling’s four eyes perked up, as they shifted down to meet Gossan’s face. “You would do that?”</p>
<p>The founder raised their helmet to return their gaze with mischief. “You’re looking at me as if I’d broken that machine on purpose,” they barked in laughter. “It just happens to be a lucky opportunity. I’ll go wait for them here, they better say their goodbyes when they pass by.” And with another knowing look, they specified with fondness: “To the both of us.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Somehow, by some miracle, Hal reached the observatory before the end of the night, having encountered no other obstacle.</p>
<p class=vs>Just from approaching the entrance to the museum, their eyes widened. Hornfels had warned them that they would be done prepping the statue today; but seeing it for themself, no longer within a dusty crate in the backroom, but as a fully fledged exhibit highlighting all its splendor and majesty, made their heart flutter with excitement.</p>
<p>The Nomai statue was towering far above them, and Hal would not have had it any other way. Or, well, perhaps they could have had it <i>just</i> a little lower so it could be easier to study its shapes for their attempts at whittling them into little sticks, but– the thought was still there. This statue radiated the eons of hidden History it possessed, and Hal had nothing but deep reverence for everything it was embodying. Hornfels truly had found the best way to give this masterpiece the respect it deserved.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Hearthian, Hornfels was standing just behind the statue, dusting their hands with a massive grin on their face, admiring from the other side a completed work well done.</p>
<p>They called out happily, and the curator instantly perked up at the sound of their voice. “Hal! Why, good morning! Your timing could not be more fortunate, I’d just asked Gossan earlier to go look for you– This statue is finally ready for display!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I can see that!” the hatchling squealed in turn, completely ignoring the other remark about the flight coach they had run into on their way, too busy counting the stars of wonder which shone out of their eyes. “You did an amazing job, it looks <i>fantastic</i>.”</p>
<p class=vs>Long ago, Firn, and then later Riebeck, had asked them why they were not wishing to apply for the Outer Wilds Ventures training, if they were this fascinated by the Nomai. But Hal did not care about space, they could leave the thrill and motion sickness to those who sought it.</p>
<p>They were excited, yes, but they were also patient; and as such, they were quite content to make do with what those who had opted for exploration would bring back home. Who needed to chase the stars out there in the sky, when they could be brought down here, right into their palms and surrounded by all the tools they needed to study them? If they’d ever feel the urge to go to space, it would only be for the sake of the Nomai, not for space itself. Riebeck surely could relate with that feeling, they simply had found in themself the decisiveness to actually go through with it.</p>
<p>Looking up with a similar expression, Hornfels breathed in satisfaction; then, reluctantly, they detached their eyes from the sight and turned them to the youth by their side. “Ah… It pains me to leave this statue, but I do have a first launch to supervise,” they announced with a teasing wink.</p>
<p>Hal sent them a smile, trying to tame their worry. “Is the weather going to be okay?”</p>
<p>“It has been all day yesterday and up until the first sunrise this morning,” they assured confidently. “I will ensure nothing has changed, but I trust you have seen the sky yourself: not a cloud in sight. The flight conditions could hardly be any more ideal for takeoff.”</p>
<p>Hal gave a nod, confirming that they had seen as much.</p>
<p>“I’ll be upstairs,” the founder announced happily. “You can tell Firn to go find me once they arrive, I will be looking for their launch codes. Have fun admiring the statue in my stead!”</p>
<p>After these last words, Hal burst into honest laughter. They would do that <i>all day</i> if they could.</p>
<hr>
<p>Even the sound of footsteps resonating on the same planks of wood they were standing on failed to pull Hal out of their reverie. Instead, as those footsteps quietened all the while sneaking dangerously closer, what brought them back to reality with the subtlety of a cold bucket of water was the discomfort of someone blowing a small but perfectly aimed puff of air right into their ear.</p>
<p>Jumping almost a full meter above the ground (maybe the Attlerock was passing by and its tidal pull helped a little bit), Hal squeaked while plastering a hand against it and turning towards the source of this assault; then, as soon as they identified the risk, their face melted into laughter. “Firn, how <i>old</i> are you to still make these jokes?”</p>
<p>Ignoring their question, the newcomer crossed their arms with mock jealousy. “I see you’ve found a new best friend to replace me while I’m gone,” they teased with a toothy grin.</p>
<p>From anyone else, such remark would have been met with flushed cheeks and fumbling apologies. From Firn, though, Hal had long learned to reply with a roll of their lower eyes and a half-amused, half-annoyed snicker.</p>
<p>“It <i>is</i> beautiful, though, don’t you think?” they sighed dreamily as they once again turned to it. “Can you realize that we can finally have an idea what the Nomai used to look like? And– I’m still not over it even if I’ve seen it weeks ago, but do you see all that fur? <i>Silkmoths</i> have fur! That’s so weird!”</p>
<p>“You think they had a larval stage too?” Firn laughed, finding the sight quite hard to imagine, yet willing to indulge in it just for the sake of being able to call the mental image funny.</p>
<p>“We have yet to see any of their writings describe anything of the sort,” Hal shrugged. “But who knows, maybe you will once you’re out there.” Marking a pause, they blinked in sudden recollection and studied their friend up and down, evidently searching for an item in particular. “Speaking of, where’s the translator? Did you have someone prep it inside your ship already?”</p>
<p>With a smirk, Firn reached into their back, pulled out of their belt the tool in question, and made its tiny, thin and light shape whirl between their fingers for a full rotation or two before they grabbed its handle and held it firmly.</p>
<p>This latest stunt wrested an anxious hiss and two pairs of bulging eyes out of Hal, who just barely calmed down upon seeing a second later that everything was in control. They still bit their lip and frowned. “I-it’s <i>fragile</i>, Firn! <i>Please</i> don’t handle it like that. Geez– If you <i>break</i> it, I swear I’ll…”</p>
<p>For the first time this morning, the cadet’s smug expression softened ever so slightly. “Hey, relax, I’m gonna protect it with my <i>life</i>,” they said instantly with determination, and Hal knew they were being sincere. It was almost a shame that the smug grin instantly came back: “I mean, you’re not the only one who’s spent months of your life perfecting it, you know. I don’t want to see all that hard work go to waste either.”</p>
<p>They were met with a deadpan look. Firn be thrown into the depths of Dark Bramble if they so much as let any genuine kindness whatsoever be seen by others for more than <i>five seconds</i>. It was no wonder most people were so easily fed up with them.</p>
<p>“You’re insufferable.”</p>
<p>“And owning it with pride.”</p>
<p>They really would never change, would they? It somehow was this constant blend of masquerades and incongruous sincerity that Hal could never understand, and yet found so fascinating. Firn knew that they were one of the few who could see through their jokes, and… In a way, that made Hal feel special in their eyes. Firn had never called anyone else their best friend, and Hal could hardly imagine the prospect that they ever would.</p>
<p>Hal sighed, eyes going back and forth between their friend and the statue. “So, any plans while you’re out there?”</p>
<p>Firn pouted, looking at the ceiling and shrugging with a disinterested tilt of their head. “Ehh, I think I’ll start small with the Attlerock. I’m still not sure how safe those retro-rockets are,” and their expression had already turned into closed smug eyes and a cocky smile. Opening their upper eyes again, then their lower ones, they dared shed their brashness, and instead let their genuine excitement shine as they whispered and exclaimed at the same time: “Besides, I bet you’re <i>dying</i> to know what kind of device the Nomai were calibrating there! I know <i>I</i> am.”</p>
<p class=vs>Hal’s eyes lit up just as much at the sound of these words. Years ago, Feldspar had brought back from their first successful expedition a wall with the very first Nomai writings to be found in outer space; the very same wall that had given both them and Firn a wave of wonder and awe, and the determination to one day decipher its secrets.</p>
<p>The idea that on this very day, Outer Wilds Ventures would finally get to find out what these Cassava and Filix were talking about… Oh, they were so excited that it made them feel nauseous.</p>
<p>“Anyway,” Firn concluded with their usual detached and smug tone, “it’s not that I don’t like your company, but I’ve got some launch codes to fetch. Can’t figure out the secrets of the Nomai if I don’t get off this rock first.”</p>
<p>With a sad blink, Hal’s smile turned bittersweet. “Right. Almost forgot you had to go.”</p>
<p>Tentatively, with pleading eyes, they dared raise their hands and ask for one last hug. Firn pursed their lips, looking around their surroundings nervously, before stepping forward and accepting it.</p>
<p>For what had to be the sixth time or so, Hal rolled their eyes. “<i>Relax</i>, burnt mallow, nobody’s watching. Your reputation isn’t gonna crumble just by letting <i>some</i> caramel ooze out instead of carcinogens when you bid your heartfelt goodbyes.”</p>
<p>“Tsh. And you say <i>I’m</i> insufferable,” the cadet snickered; but their embrace tightened, and for but a short second, there was one small insistent shake of their arms as they squeezed tighter still.</p>
<p>Both childhood friends remained like this in silence, taking in their last moments together; but alas, this magical moment could not last forever.</p>
<p>Pulling out of their embrace and sharing one last fond glance with all four eyes, Firn’s smile softened. “Hey. If you ever miss me, you know you can just go ask Hornfels to radio me, I’m sure they won’t mind. I promise I’ll pick up. I’ll try to keep you updated on what I find on the Attlerock ruins, too, in real time! …Assuming I’m not too busy jumping around and having fun with the low gravity.”</p>
<p>Closing their eyes and shaking their head, Hal crossed their arms and smiled. “Yep. Insufferable.” With one last look, they sighed deeply, before concluding with a twinge of regret they tried their best to stifle: “Go on, don’t let me hold you back. Just make sure to take care of yourself, you hear?”</p>
<p class=vs>As sole answer, they received a single, tiny but sincere nod. With one last shared wave, Hal watched as their best friend walked out of the room and up the stairs to the observatory. They took a few steps forward, only stopping at the edge of the door leading to the rest of the museum’s exhibits, and their eyes followed from a distance until the ceiling hid them from view. And then… only then did the realization truly hit.</p>
<p>In this instant, for the first time in their life, Hal felt loneliness; and with it, there came a pang in their stomach as a feeling of inexplicable dread grew in their heart: the feeling that it would be a long, long time, until they would ever truly see them again.</p>
<p>Far was it from their mind to know just how true both of these statements were going to become.</p>
<hr>
<p class=vs>Thinking that Firn would have to step down those very same stairs anyway in order to walk out of the museum and reach the launch tower, Hal had decided to stay right where they were, and to go back to admiring the statue.</p>
<p>No matter how many times they looked, they could never get tired of the sight; every new second of observation seemed to reveal yet another detail they had missed before.</p>
<p class=vs>With a hand to their satchel, they plunged their fingers inside and felt the carved wood of their previous ongoing attempts at trying to recreate it. They couldn’t help it, perhaps they were indeed obsessed with this statue, almost as much as Hornfels was.</p>
<p>Looking down, they pulled out the stick they had picked up on the evening before. If they were going to wait for their friend’s return, they might as well busy their hands with something in the meantime.</p>
<p class=vs>Their knife started digging into the wood, but then they stopped and frowned.</p>
<p>Right. It simply wouldn’t do to proceed with the whittling here, they’d be getting sawdust all over the place. It hadn’t been much of an issue before in the workshop since it already was a mess anyway, but this was a <i>museum</i>, and Dark Bramble take them if they would be even the <i>last</i> Hearthian to dare soil this room.</p>
<p>Raising one last glance at the statue, they tried to memorize its shape as best they could, then lowered their gaze towards the exit and went on their way; not suspecting a single second that a long-awaited discovery from the furthest reaches of their solar system was about to be made, and that in less than a minute, its image would be indelibly carved not on wood, but directly into their own mind.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal was just passing by the exhibit when their ears caught the clang at the start of a mechanical whirr– or rather, of the gritting and inexplicable sound of stone scraping against stone.</p>
<p>Jumping in surprise, they tilted their head around and looked over their shoulder, then spun their entire body and opened their mouth, ready to scream—</p>
<p>The statue opened its eyes.</p>
</div>

<div class=chp id=ch2_1><h1>Chapter 2</h1><h2>9,318,054</h2><hr>
<p>As much as all the intricacies of the Nomai’s greatest technological achievement had attempted to take such basic parameters into account, the process of pairing with a statue had never been expected to be a particularly enjoyable experience.</p>
<p class=vs>In this regard, never had Phlox or Daz ever intended to imply or pretend the opposite — provided, alas, they could ever be given the chance to be inquired about it.</p>
<p>Had the circumstances been any different, both would have graciously shared the forewarning with any Nomai, or even any other lifeform who might end up involved in their project, willingly or otherwise; and naturally, they would have put in all the necessary hard work to ensure that the latter case would be a risk fully secured into the realm of impossibility.</p>
<p>After all, it simply was a well-known fact, or at the very least a quite intuitively conceivable one, that nature had never felt the need to prepare any species in the entire universe for the eventuality that a living, conscious observer’s brain, would one day be asked to share with an alien contraption the surprisingly immense amount of information and cerebral stimuli that could be amassed and recorded during the past thirty-two minutes of a regular Hearthian’s casual morning, and to then process it all over again in reverse within the span of no more than three seconds and seventy-eight hundredths.</p>
<p>Adding to this the additional margins of error brought upon by the subtle differences in biology which could only be expected of two species with vastly diverging anatomies and metabolisms who originated from two respectively foreign star systems, as well as the entire multi-planet-scale device’s old age in spite of its remarkably close to intact state of preservation… It was not particularly difficult to come to a very simple conclusion:</p>
<p>Hal’s next three seconds and seventy-eight hundredths following the exact moment of the statue’s eyes opening were far from pleasant.</p>
<p>Linguist as they were, Hal found themself unable to find words to describe whatever had just transpired in the confines of their mind; though, admittedly, this predicament may have been related to the fact that for the next few instants, they found themself already busy attempting to remember how to comprehend an abstract and artificial concept as profoundly complex and unintuitive as recognizing up from down.</p>
<p>The next moment, they heard loud steps running in their direction. Every ounce of intelligence and awareness they had been gifted at birth and proceeded to actively nurture ever since came back in a flash — including the now inherent knowledge that, a few seconds ago, those footsteps had been running <i>down</i>wards, and had therefore at some prior point originated from <i>up</i>wards. Upstairs, even.</p>
<p>“Hal, are you alright!?”</p>
<p>Hal forced all four eyelids closed, then open, then closed and open again, <i>hard</i>. Their light-headed neck rotated towards the source of this panicked sound, not unlike how the statue had done just a moment before.</p>
<p>It was Firn. Judging from their bewildered expression, they must have finished walking down the stairs just in time to witness the same strangeness that they just had. Which meant…</p>
<p>“Did… did you <i>see</i> that?” they asked weakly, pointing with a quivering arm at the three golden orbs which an instant prior were shining bright and <i>sucking in their mind somehow</i>, but had now gone extinguished.</p>
<p>“Almost missed it, but yeah! That statue just moved on its own!” Rushing to it without a single thought, Firn placed a hand on the empty eyeballs, poking the central one tentatively. “Weren’t its eyes <i>closed</i> before!? Did you know it could open them?”</p>
<p class=vs>With their best friend’s swift curiosity and enthusiasm, Hal could feel a small but rapidly growing headache fill their brain. Describing their mind as <i>cloudy</i> would be a mistake, as in fact, they could feel their thoughts as far more lucid and almost <i>tangible</i> as they had ever been before, but… Well.</p>
<p>It would be more akin to the sensation that <i>something</i> had dug straight into their head, like a young misbehaved hatchling sneaking into Hornfels’ records and stealing one specific cassette whose contents would be related to the past half sunrise or so — then unwound their thoughts memory by memory the same way this same hatchling would enjoy themself seizing the end of the tape and pulling it all out of its casing, little by little, in reverse, with ignorant yet cruel glee — and finally, once finished, left the whole thing for the recorder’s owner to sort out the mess and carefully coil the tape back into the neat black cylindrical reel it was supposed to be left as.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal found themself wincing in confusion when they reluctantly tried to seize the metaphorical tape and do just that: indeed, the moment they tried to focus on putting their latest memories back in order, it was almost as if they could feel themself <i>be there</i> all over again, standing simultaneously inside the museum looking at an excited Firn, and somehow also outside, on the path between the patch of ghost matter and the zero-g cave, talking to a Gossan that they thankfully could tell did not truly exist.</p>
<p>The only solace they found was that they had just enough awareness to remember which of the two settings was the real one, and the fact that the imaginary Hal standing outside by the cliff was talking to Gossan regardless of their present self’s intent helped a lot in this regard. Still– never had reminiscing ever had any right to feel so <i>real</i>.</p>
<p>Just when they thought that Firn would remain completely oblivious to their state of mind and be enthralled by the Nomai statue just as deeply as they themself once had, another pained and slow blink conveniently hid the moment during which the young cadet turned around, their curious and excited smile having turned upside down. “…Wait, no, sorry. Hal, are you okay? You look <i>awful</i>.”</p>
<p class=vs>Hal blinked again, the gesture becoming progressively less strained. The tape of their memories was being recoiled carefully, and they felt immense relief when they realized that those related to their conversation with Gossan had now been put back in order, with the next ones being their quiet past self walking up to the museum. But far too soon came the turn of reviewing their enthusiastic moments spent with Hornfels instead, and again they closed their eyes and sighed, trying their best to ignore both the curator and their past self, and to focus on saying out loud the words they actually wanted to say, instead of those they had already spoken at some earlier point. Admittedly though, keeping their silence altogether was actually the safest bet.</p>
<p>This was such a confusing, and most distressing feeling — the feeling that they could go back and observe their own memories with excruciating detail, as if they were back in the past living through them a second time, all the while feeling like a distant observer trapped within their own body, incapable of interfering with events that had already been set in time. That they could not shake the precognition that it felt as if something <i>else</i> was taking the role of an observer at the same time as they did… Both truths left them struggling to focus proper, and struggling even harder not to let their body tremble in panic, or their nauseated and stressed out stomach churn and turn upside down, their breakfast along with it.</p>
<p>And then came the part they had been dreading the most. To their own despair, Hal now felt themself standing in two different parts of the same room, talking to two different versions of Firn at the same time.</p>
<p>One of the two waved an arm in front of their eyes, filled with concern. “…Hal? Hello?”</p>
<p class=vs>They were pretty sure that this Firn was not from the memory. They were asking a question, and they looked progressively more worried.</p>
<p>Right, if this was the real one, they probably should be answering.</p>
<p>“You’re insufferable,” their lips sluggishly let out by instinct, before their eyes widened and they instantly recoiled in embarrassment. “N-no, wait, wrong one–”</p>
<p>While the echo of the other Firn responded with a smug <i>‘And owning it with pride’</i>, the worried one turned from concern, to confusion <i>and</i> triple the concern. “<i>What?</i>”</p>
<p>“S-<span class=scaps>s</span>orry, just–” Deep breath. “Give me– just a minute.” That would have to do, hopefully.</p>
<p>They decided to close their eyes firmly, inhale loudly, and go back to silence until it was finished. They were almost there, thankfully the memory replaying seemed to be going much faster than the event they represented once had in the real world.</p>
<p>They could not fully tell what present Firn was doing now, but they considered the fact that they only heard a single set of Firn voices playing in the back of their mind in speed motion as a sign that they had probably listened to their plea and fallen silent.</p>
<p>After what had been both a dozen seconds or two, and felt like sixty times that amount, Hal’s mental vision finally aligned with that of their actual eyes: that was to say, the pitch black of their closed eyelids. Letting their head fall backwards, Hal gave a long sigh, then slowly opened their eyes. They felt something on their left shoulder and looked down: Firn’s hand was pressed against it, gentle but insistent. Too embarrassed to break the silence just yet, Hal sent their friend a shy look accompanied with a small grateful smile.</p>
<p>Firn’s eyebrows twitched, staring intently. The light grip on their shoulder gave a small squeeze. “Feeling better now?”</p>
<p>Hal opened their mouth, taking in one last breath. “Yeah… Yeah. Sorry for all that,” they sighed in relief. “That was… wow, that headache felt like a whole dozen of geysers going off at once.” Probably better to call it a ‘headache’ than a… whatever that had just been. Raising a sheepish look at their friend, they quickly added: “But it’s over now, I-<span class=scaps>i</span> think.”</p>
<p>After a short hesitation, the cadet frowned with uncertainty, gave a small nod, and freed their shoulder, retracting their hand. “Any idea what all of that was? First the statue moving on its own, and then… Well, even from you, that was quite the reaction, don’t you think?”</p>
<p class=vs>Hal nodded weakly, stifling a strained laugh. That sure was one way to put it.</p>
<p>Indeed, what even <i>had</i> happened? Hal tried to find so little as a semblance of an answer in recalling what had transpired in this very room barely two or three minutes ago, and — <i>oh no</i>.</p>
<p>Hal saw mental images and sounds surfacing in the back of their mind, and for one moment, they feared that it would be the whole ‘reliving the past and present simultaneously’ experience all over again. However, to their greatest relief, they immediately realized this time that, with those memories being now put in order instead of floating away from their proper place, it had become much easier to keep them under control and make them fade at will. As easy, in a way, as it should be to press play, reverse, forward, and pause, and then put the whole cassette back on its shelf in the records room.</p>
<p class=vs>Nonetheless. Trying not to think too hard about the utter strangeness of it all, Hal searched for the metaphorical cassette they were looking for, finding it in an instant almost before they even had realized that this was the one they were looking for — almost as if something <i>else</i> had first found it for them and shoved it into their hands, responding to their request before they could have found the time to even phrase it.</p>
<p>With an entire body shaking in barely controlled panic and a deep focused breath, they put the recent memory under close, analytical scrutiny, feeling once again as if they were assisted in the process by some external force. Whatever it was, if it existed at all, it sure was insistent – steadfastly bent on making them keep a greedy grip on those moments, on never allowing themself to let them slip away from their mind, on having them dissect every detail of it, for fear that something could possibly erase them soon.</p>
<p class=vs>Anyway.</p>
<p class=vs>Firn had described the statue’s movements.</p>
<p>Nothing about the eyes glowing, or the… the <i>glowing</i> in general, or the <i>everything else</i>.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, there was only one explanation as to why anyone with an iota of common sense, but especially someone like <i>Firn</i>, would express surprise for the former, but not even bother acknowledging the latter’s existence, save for the external effects it had on Hal themself. And so, this reasoning led to one disappointing conclusion:</p>
<p>“…So you didn’t see it,” they mumbled weakly with a twinge of sadness.</p>
<p>Firn frowned again. “See what?”</p>
<p>To be fair, they themself were not certain that they had quite <i>seen</i> any of these floating purple strings, or the eyes’ purple light swallowing them all, either. Not with… not really with their own four eyes, that was. Rather with whichever mental eyes were the ones responsible for making them relive their memories with this amount of vividness which nature should have, and probably <i>did have</i> rightfully prohibited.</p>
<p>Still. Linguistics be thrown to the bramble for just five minutes, because they truly needed at least <i>some</i> amount of leniency, ‘seeing’ would have to do. “I… I think I… saw my own memories replay before me? <i>Backwards?</i>” Yeah. That sounded good enough. This sentence sounded crazy enough on its own, there was no need for even more words that would only make it sound sixty times worse.</p>
<p class=vs>Firn’s eyebrows were raised at first; but soon, their gaze softened instead, as a gentle but teasing smirk appeared in the corner of their lips. “Saw your life flashing before your eyes, huh?” They laughed with their usual sarcasm, though they still gave a genuine attempt at not sounding condescending. “I mean, <i>yeah</i>, I bet seeing that huge thing move on its own just to stare you down would scare the living daylights out of anyone. <span class=smol>…Especially you. No offense.</span>”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite the light dismissiveness of their words, there was a twinge of doubt in the corner of their upper eyes; stupidly easy to startle as Hal was, <i>surely</i> they should have handled this jumpscare better than that… Right?</p>
<p>Hal looked to the ground, humming unconvincingly. That was… a <i>decent enough</i> explanation, perhaps? They replied with a strained chuckle. “Heh… You’d think it was just that. That’d… make sense, I guess.” Turning their eyes to their friend, they tried to replicate their relaxed laugh. It came quite a little bit broken. “Still, I can’t help but feel like… there was more to it?”</p>
<p class=vs>Taking a deep but tense breath right in the next second, Hal tried to appreciate the fact that their mind had finally been allowed to store all the metaphorical cassettes inside their proper metaphorical shelves, and then closed the metaphorical doors to the metaphorical records room, and that with this, their headache was slowly but surely starting to fade in turn.</p>
<p>Now that their thoughts could fully focus on living through no other event than the present, though… The more seconds slipped by, the more distant and outlandish their previous sensations became, fading into none but the blur of a dream in the back of their mind. And as a consequence, with those same seconds slipping by… the more they questioned the possibility that all of this had been nothing but a <i>particularly potent</i> nauseating hallucination caused by their own tendency to scare themself to death at even the tiniest little things.</p>
<p class=vs>They did not know whether trying to reminisce yet another memory on purpose would trigger it again, but truthfully, something they did know was that they <i>did not want to find out</i>. The thought that they had simply had a very weird episode of their own brain turning against them somehow felt more comforting than the prospect of this kind of thing… being permanent.</p>
<p>Feeling the pressure of Firn’s skeptical eyes boring four holes of extreme doubt directly into their skull, what little confidence they had in that ridiculous theory finished crumbling to dust.</p>
<p>“…Ugh, what am I saying,” they sighed tiredly, bringing a hand to their forehead and rubbing away the last trails of tension on their face. “Did the Nomai even have mind-reading technology? Is it even possible?” With another sigh, their other hand went to follow the first so they could rub both pairs of eyes at once. “Forget I said anything. Maybe I just need to lay down for a bit.”</p>
<p>The last remaining traces of Firn’s already fake smirk faltered completely, letting their ears drop with the smallest signs of guilt. Crossing their arms and regaining a determined expression, they turned their eyes again to the latest museum exhibit and huffed with disgruntlement, mind scrambling for any trail which could lead to even the <i>beginning</i> of an explanation.</p>
<p>In the end, they decided to drop any jokes and jump down into the realm of the steady and rough solid grounds normally called <i>evidence</i>. “Well, whatever happened, what’s for sure is that this statue did <i>some</i>thing. It’s been on this planet for <i>weeks</i> and you’ve been standing here <i>all morning</i> for all I know, so why’d it only act up <i>now?</i> You didn’t touch it somewhere new or anything, did you?”</p>
<p>Hal shook their head. “Absolutely not, I was even on my way to <i>leave</i>.”</p>
<p>Firn’s lips opened instinctively, ready to offer the sarcastic hypothesis that perhaps the statue was just feeling lonely and did not want its greatest admirator to abandon it; but just as quickly, they found the physical restraint to close their mouth before it came out.</p>
<p>Tapping an index finger against their elbow with increasingly faster velocity and stronger impact, they pursed their lips and grunted with the frustration of facing a roadblock. A short moment later, they looked Hal up and down one more time, assessing their state, before turning again to the statue. “Where’d you say it came from again?”</p>
<p>Hal’s hands finally managed to stop trembling, they just noticed after looking down. Raising their head back to their best friend, they frowned, then replied with decisiveness: “Giant’s Deep. It was Gabbro who found it.”</p>
<p>Firn nodded. Their back was still turned to them, but they rotated their head just enough for Hal to see that they were sending them a mischievous grin. Mischievous not out of ill intent at the prospect of them preparing another nefarious plan, or at least they did not believe so… But rather, this mischief appeared to have found its spark in the hope of finally having a thread to start with.</p>
<p>“Forget the Attlerock. I know which planet I’m crashing my ship into.”</p>
<p>Hal’s ears twitched nervously, face crumpling in worry. “D-do you <i>have</i> to say ‘crash’?” they cringed, trying all over again to dismiss the mental image. Fortunately, it was the mental image of something that had never happened, so it seemed like their brain would not suddenly try to go look for a cassette that did not exist and force them to witness it. “Also, that’s not… You think Hornfels would agree to let you go there on your first trip? From what Gabbro said, it sounds pretty dangerous, with the current, and the storms, not to mention the—”</p>
<p>Firn rolled their eyes in annoyance. “I’ll <i>make</i> them agree. It’s important to you, and it’s related to the statue they’ve been obsessing over. With reasons as big as that, I’m sure they’ll allow a last-minute change of plans.”</p>
<p>They tried to argue, but by the time their mouth opened, their friend had already grabbed their wrist, looking at them with four eyes filled with determination.</p>
<p>“Come on,” they said with a much softer tone and an encouraging smile. “You’ll even get to scold me over the radio if you feel like it. Sure Hornfels would like for that to happen.”</p>
<p>With an anxious sigh, Hal reluctantly let their friend guide them to the observatory. Before they turned around and aimed for the stairs, they gave one last glance at the statue — this time, not with awe, but with disdain and apprehension.</p>
<p>Even now that they had broken eye contact with it… Somehow, they still felt distinctly observed.</p>
<hr>
<p>The moment Hornfels heard that the statue’s eyes had opened, their ears closed to any other potential detail to that story, and their role as ground control had been all but forgotten. With only one idea in mind, the one who had now put on their museum curator’s hat instead wanted nothing to do with the observatory, and everything to do with the statue room.</p>
<p>Which was precisely why Firn did everything in their power to stop them from leaving their post.</p>
<p>“Firn, how can you share such news and not even let me <i>study</i> it!? I’ve spent night after night for <i>weeks</i> trying to get those eyes to open, and now that they have, you won’t let me go down and find out why they did? Just go to the Attlerock like we all agreed, surely you don’t need me for that!”</p>
<p>“And that’s what I’m trying to tell you, Hornfels, that’s <i>exactly</i> why I’m going to <i>Giant’s Deep!</i>”</p>
<p>“You can’t just change your flight plans at the last second, let alone on your first launch! Why would you even want to go this far off-planet when I already have all the tools I could ever need inside the workshop?”</p>
<p>Firn rolled their eyes. “And I say it’ll be much more useful to investigate directly the place where it came from! What are you going to do, stay in the museum, point your signalscope at it, and look for brain waves all day?”</p>
<p>The curator frowned, leaving their desk and making their way towards the stairs. “I’m not sure why you would mention <i>brain waves</i> specifically, but I will have you know that using an encephalogram under these circumstances would be a far more relevant approach—”</p>
<p>The astronaut crossed their arms and frowned deeply, deliberately blocking the path. “Hornfels, I’m getting off this rock <i>today</i>, and I’m gonna figure this whole thing out right from where that statue came from. I have the translator and a radio, I can report everything I find in real time!”</p>
<p>“Firn, as much as I value your interest in solving this statue’s mystery, you really shouldn’t change your flight schedule at such short notice,” the founder tried to reason with cautious concern. “This is your first launch, you need to understand that Giant’s Deep might remain a little more than you can chew for now. You will have all the time to investigate there on later expeditions, and perhaps find more statues to study—”</p>
<p>Firn’s fists clenched. Barely controlled boiling blood coiled into a thick ball inside their throat. “It’s not about the <i>statue</i>, Hornfels!” they finally exploded. “It did <i>something</i> to Hal, and I’m going to <i>find out</i> what it was, you hear me?”</p>
<p>Hal gasped, looking wide-eyed at their friend. They were not sure what to think… Had Firn actually believed their story about the statue reading their mind? But also, were they even planning on convincing Hornfels as well…?</p>
<p>Speaking of Hornfels, their eyebrows fell at once, gaze now jumping from one hatchling to the other back and forth, as they startled as well — albeit, for a different reason. “What exactly do you mean by ‘did something’?”</p>
<p>“I said I was <i>going</i> to find out,” Firn repeated angrily.</p>
<p>The curator turned to their friend with confusion and concern. “Hal, what are they talking about? The statue turned to you and opened its eyes, that much I understand, but– there was <i>more</i> to it?”</p>
<p>Hal took a step back, unsure how to describe their experience and make it sound anything other than utterly mad and nonsensical. “It’s… it’s complicated, I didn’t even think Firn would– believe me.”</p>
<p>Firn crossed their arms. “Which is why I’m saying I’m not sure what happened,” they stated coldly.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal’s ears dropped at the same time as their eyes turning to the ground. That made more sense; of course they wouldn’t accept something so outlandish just like that.</p>
<p class=vs>They were, however, quite surprised to feel Firn grabbing their wrist and squeezing lightly, as if to try and somewhat comfort them. When they looked up at their face, they found the expression that had truly earned Firn’s place in the Outer Wilds Ventures program:</p>
<p>The expression of a dedicated, analytical and thorough investigator.</p>
<p>“<i>Something</i> happened alright, <i>I was right there</i>,” Firn continued. “But Hal says there was more to it, something only they saw— something to do with their mind, or memories, right?” The cadet gave a quick look in their direction; Hal gave them a tiny nod, and they nodded in return with a hum. “Point is, it’s hard for now to tell how much of it was just Hal trying to recover from the fright, and how much of it was the statue <i>really</i> doing something. But I’m willing to believe that if a however-old-that-thing-is statue just moved on its own to specifically turn towards them— I hardly think the Nomai would create that kind of thing just for the sake of scaring people out of their skins. It <i>had</i> to have another purpose.”</p>
<p>It had been a whole minute or two since Hornfels had fallen silent, listening to their reasoning; their face made it hard to tell whether it was because they were actively listening and agreeing with this train of logic, or if they had simply given up on trying to stop them.</p>
<p>Firn let go of their arm so they could go back to crossing their own, and with one last head tilt upwards, they brought their demonstration to its conclusion: “And now I’m getting to my real point: <i>even</i> if whatever happened was all in Hal’s head and the statue did nothing else, I still believe the statue was <i>meant</i> to do something else; and if it didn’t do it, it means either that it’s broken, or that Gabbro took it away from the rest of the mechanism it was supposed to be a part of, which also means that it’s technically broken. In both cases: we have <i>zero chances</i> of figuring out what the statue was meant to do by staring at it downstairs, and our only way to find any answers is to explore Giant’s Deep.”</p>
<p>And with those last words being uttered, the young cadet fell silent and stared defiantly, wordlessly daring Hornfels to so much as try to think of a counterargument.</p>
<p>Hal was impressed, that was for sure. Impressed by what, however, was far less certain. Were they more impressed by the apparent flawlessness and fluidity of their reasoning, or by the fact that at the end of the day, the sole objective behind said reasoning had been nothing but the self-centered motivation of making it impossible to stop them from doing what they wanted?</p>
<p>Hornfels stared for what had to be almost an entire minute. Then, they brought an exasperated hand to their lowered face and started rubbing the bridge of their nose. With a heavy and loud defeated sigh, they conceded: “<i>Fine</i>, have it your way! But I am <i>not</i> letting you do this alone. Go meet up with Gabbro first, you are going to need someone who has the field experience.”</p>
<p>Firn’s smirk turned insufferably triumphant. It was not a complete victory, but it was good enough, and just about the best outcome they could have hoped for. “Deal.”</p>
<p>And without any other word, the newest astronaut turned around and practically ran down the stairs, barely sending Hal one last wave with a distracted hand.</p>
<p>Hal so dearly hoped that Gabbro would manage to keep them safe.</p><p>Somehow.</p>
<hr>
<p>Taking off had been easy. Firn remembered their training, they had located and memorized all the buttons on their dashboard weeks ago down to their size and color, and they had no reason to stay a single second longer than necessary on the soil of Timber Hearth.</p>
<p>Locating Giant’s Deep while out of the atmosphere had been a little more difficult. Firn remembered that it was high up in the zenith when they woke up, but that was just about a whole hour earlier; and in this span of time, the planet had been granted enough time to get to the other side of the Hearthian sky.</p>
<p>Locating Gabbro became even harder when Firn realized that they probably should have remembered to turn on their ship’s signalscope <i>before</i> entering its atmosphere and having to suddenly keep all four eyes not on trying to find the signal of a barely audible flute (were they even playing at all? They could not pick up any signal on planet), but instead on the dozen of cyclones raging all around them.</p>
<p>Firn did not want to admit to Hornfels that <i>maybe</i> their training had not quite yet taught them how to time last-second dodges between moving walls of wind and water.</p>
<p>And <i>Gabbro</i>— What were they <i>doing?</i> They couldn’t pick up their signal anywhere!</p>
<p class=vs>Another cyclone had to be dodged— and as they were forced to turn around in a full half circle in order to evade <i>yet another</i>, they sputtered in shock as they saw an entire <i>island</i> fall from the sky, and right back into the ocean.</p>
<p>Wait… A black trail seemed to be coming out of it. Was that smoke? A campfire!</p>
<p>Their signalscope finally decided to pick up a sound coming from the Outer Wilds Ventures frequency. Gabbro’s flute was always the hardest to listen to due to its low volume and pitch, and the surrounding howling winds certainly did not make it any easier now… But if on top of this the island had not even <i>been</i> on the surface of the planet until just a few seconds ago, then <i>of course</i> trying to locate it was a plan bound for failure.</p>
<p class=vs>Still, that was not all. Firn instantly noticed that this time… Gabbro’s playing sounded a lot more strained and tired than usual.</p><p>To be fair, if Firn themself had been the one being thrown up into orbit and then back down like this, they likely would not be playing at all… But still. This kind of playing was not by a long shot the most Gabbro-like, and they could only try to imagine why.</p>
<p>Well, whatever was happening, it was no use trying to play guessing games when they could simply find out upon landing. A minute more, and their ship made physical contact with solid ground, landing in an area which was mercifully as flat as wild terrain could ever hope to be.</p>
<p>Firn unbuckled, checked the airtightness of their suit just like Gossan had taught them, then opened the hatch and jumped down.</p>
<p>…and instantly regretted their thoughtless leap, as their knees sent shivers up their spine with what felt like the closest thing they thought they would ever get to breaking their legs.</p>
<p>They frowned at the ground, attempting another jump only to barely manage not to collapse under their own doubled weight, and to barely fail at repressing the instinct to flail their arms around to maintain their balance upon landing.</p>
<p>Right. Giant’s Deep was a <i>giant</i>. Gravity was on average double that of Timber Hearth. Ow.</p>
<p>So much for looking forward to the Attlerock’s low gravity and the fun prospect of magically losing two thirds of their usual weight.</p>
<p>With an exasperated sigh, Firn reached out for their signalscope and followed the music, minding the patch of ghost matter that they soon noticed nearby.</p>
<p>And then, finally, there stood Gabbro. And by ‘stood’, it would be far more appropriate to specify that they were, in fact, not standing at all, unless ‘standing’ horizontally inside a hammock could be a grammatically correct wording. Firn instantly frowned and let a groan resonate inside their throat, because <i>of course they would</i>.</p>
<p>Turning on their helmet’s radio emitter, they called out with the most polite tone and hand wave they could muster, and the sound of flute instantly stopped. From the hammock, a helmet ever so slightly turned and peeked out, looking around somewhat groggily until their eyes could pinpoint the source. Cons of having to rely on radio for communication even when both parties were barely a dozen meters apart: you could not trust your ears to locate the other’s spacial position relative to yours.</p>
<p>“Firn? Oh hey, it’s really you,” Gabbro greeted, voice still crackling through the receiver despite their proximity. “Good to see you made it here in one piece. The first solo launch is a doozy, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class=vs>Firn hummed deep in thought as they walked closer, finally making it to their side.</p>
<p>As much as <i>‘Gabbro is Gabbro’</i> was a well-known rule in the entire village, the young cadet could not fail to notice how much more… <i>out there</i> they sounded. As in, even more than usual.</p>
<p>“Let me tell you, the past ten minutes sure have been a doozy for myself too,” they continued, words coming out almost sluggish.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah? …Well, I mean, I guess I did see your entire island fall from the sky.”</p>
<p>Firn’s radio picked up on a tired, unenergetic snort. “Heh, nah, I’m used to that. Island’s only up for a minute at most, the real crazy thing started a bit earlier.” There was a short pause, as if the astronaut was actively struggling to find their words, or almost even to do so much as remain aware of the fact that they were supposed to be part of a conversation. “Another island drifted by, so I thought I’d take advantage of the proximity to do some field work and explore… but I was there for barely a minute or two when I found that… something… and then that happened. Don’t laugh, but I think I sort of, uh, had a spiritual experience with a rock shaped like a face.”</p>
<p>Firn tensed up. “You mean a statue?”</p>
<p>The older astronaut snapped their fingers and pointed at them in short-lived gratitude. “A <i>statue</i>, yes. Got uh, some words mixed up right after it happened, heh. That sure was <i>something</i>, felt like getting my whole brain turned upside down for a bit. After that I figured it’d been more than enough emotions for the day and that I’d frankly deserved some rest to, uh. Get my thoughts together before trying to go back and take a better look.”</p>
<p>Firn squinted, openly disappointed. “So you came back to lie in your hammock.”</p>
<p>Gabbro turned their helmet in their direction, eyeing them with an unreadable look. “Got a problem with that?”</p>
<p>“You don’t want to figure out what that was all about?”</p>
<p>Gabbro somehow managed to dig themself deeper inside the hammock. “As I said: <i>later</i>.” A pause. They raised their flute. “Probably.” They sighed. “Not gonna lie, it’s been <i>really</i> tempting to remove my helmet and get something done about that headache, but I don’t wanna take the risk of that fury over there coming for <i>another</i> visit.”</p>
<p>Gabbro started playing again, music once again far more strained than usual. Firn wondered why they kept playing if they could barely even keep the rhythm right.</p>
<p>Their hands clenched into fists. “Remember the statue you brought back to Timber Hearth? That happened to Hal too.”</p>
<p>There was a wheezing, far too high-pitched note, then the music stopped again. And then, silence and stillness came, as if Gabbro was pretending that this bum note had been all in Firn’s imagination. Then, a dozen seconds later:</p>
<p>“…Ah,” they mumbled flatly. Silence again. “They, uh, doing alright?”</p>
<p>“They’re holding up. They should be with Hornfels, I’d planned to radio them soon after landing.”</p>
<p>Gabbro nodded. “Good. Good. Kinda surprised they wouldn’t have, like, thrown up after this. Sure is a trip, and not the fun kind.”</p>
<p>Firn let an audible grunt resonate and die in their throat. Gabbro turned their head again.</p>
<p>“…So <i>that’s</i> why you’re here even if it’s your first launch, huh. It went after Hal, so now it got <i>personal</i>.”</p>
<p>“And you should be taking it personally too!” Firn scolded. “Hal’s gotten better after just a few minutes. Gonna put my mallows on you exaggerating it as an excuse to take the day off.”</p>
<p>A pause. The elder astronaut stared at their flute.</p>
<p>“It really was that bad, buddy.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ve seen Hal, and now that I’m seeing you too, I’ll believe you on that. Just saying— emphasis on <i>was</i>. Hal was completely back to normal just a few minutes later, save for the part where they’re obviously still freaked out about it.”</p>
<p class=vs>Gabbro mumbled something about Hal being logical and good at sorting their own ideas, and about their own brain already being messy from the start even before their statue friend threw a cyclone out of its eyes and into theirs to instantly get back out and suck basically all of their memories straight into orbit, and that <i>stars above</i> it was not fun to try maintaining a conversation when it felt like all their memories were still somewhat scrambled and vivid in their mind, so frankly they would be <i>extremely</i> thankful if they could leave and let them meditate as an attempt to chase all that away.</p><p>Firn raised an eyebrow at all that, but decided not to take any of it at face value, given the amount of evident metaphors and the lack of any solid, tangible evidence in their words.</p>
<p>“Welp,” the cadet sighed, “I’m radioing Hornfels. Thanks for the warm welcome,” they added with an annoyed roll of their upper eyes.</p>
<p>“Sure, knock yourself out,” they sighed with a dismissive wave of their hand. “Just tone it down a bit. You’re loud, it’s hard to focus. The cyclones are bad enough on their own.”</p>
<p>With another grunting sigh, Firn walked a few steps away (not that the distance would change much regarding the volume of their voice in Gabbro’s receiver, but the thought was there) and pointed their signalscope at the sky.</p>
<p>“Firn to ground control, do you copy?”</p>
<p><span class=radio>“Firn!”</span> Hal’s voice immediately rang out in both relief and panic, somehow. <span class=radio>“Y-you didn’t crash, did you?”</span></p>
<p>They stifled an amused laugh. “Well thanks for the vote of confidence. Yeah, I’m good. I found Gabbro too, as we agreed.”</p>
<p>From hundreds of kilometers away, another sigh of relief resonated, this time more likely coming from Hornfels.</p>
<p>“Say, Hal? About the statue— Gabbro said that something similar happened to them.” Then, turning to the astronaut in question: “How’d you phrase it again?”</p>
<p>“Spiritual experience with a rock shaped like a face,” they tiredly recited without hesitation. Blinking, they perked up in surprise: “…Huh. I actually remembered the exact wording.”</p>
<p>“You said it, like, two minutes ago,” Firn deadpanned.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, with how <i>backwards</i> my entire brain is right now, forgive me for being happy to find something even remotely coherent in it,” Gabbro deadpanned right back.</p>
<p>Hal’s voice crackled again through the radio. <span class=radio>“Can I, uh— Gabbro, do you remember how it was like?”</span></p>
<p>“You’re saying ‘was’ as if it were over for me,” they grumbled weakly. “Honestly, I think ‘brain backwards’ is a good enough summary.”</p>
<p class=radio>“…Ah. Uh. How long ago did the statue do the— you know, the glowing eyes thing?”</p>
<p>“A bit more than ten minutes ago. I think. Kinda hard to tell how fast time passes when I’m trying to tell apart which cyclones are real and why I’m somehow seeing and <i>hearing</i> double, with half of it being in fast motion.” A pause. “Unless it’s the other half going in slow motion. What if we were all living in slow motion, and we just never realized it? …Does ‘slow’ or ‘fast’ motion even make sense as absolutes, or do they only make sense once put in the context of a different speed? But then, what could the ‘absolute’ speed even be…?”</p>
<p>This time, the voice that came out of the radio was that of Hornfels, and they were audibly displeased. <span class=radio>“Gabbro, did you get alien algae fumes in your oxygen tank? And Hal—”</span></p>
<p>“What? No!” Gabbro cried out, hurt by the accusation. “…Not <i>this</i> time, at least.” Geysers, they did not dare imagine how much <i>horribly worse</i> that would have made this whole thing, given the fact that this was an already far too upsetting experience.</p>
<p>Hal’s voice thankfully came to their defense: <span class=radio>“N-no, I, uh, I think that sort of makes sense. It did feel like that too for me, for a little while.”</span> After a quick pause which was certainly spent trying to quietly convince Hornfels that they were not completely out of their mind, they added: <span class=radio>“At least I do have good news, Gabbro, it should be over soon. I’m pretty sure it’s all back to normal for me by now. Sort of.”</span></p>
<p class=vs>Gabbro closed their eyes and took a deep, relieved breath. Usually, they were all for new experiences; but the fact that this one was forcing them into <i>lucidity</i> instead of allowing them to embrace the hypnotic trance instigated by the twirling cyclones was something that they found not only odd, but also actively against the flow of everything they enjoyed.</p>
<p>Was it weird to say that they did not enjoy that lucidity? Probably, unless they could specify that there <i>was</i> such a thing as too much lucidity. Having your own brain make you process and relive your latest memories in the back of your mind at the same time as you were trying to hold a normal conversation <i>definitely</i> counted as too much lucidity.</p>
<p>“Cool. Nice to know,” they nodded, already feeling calmer from that news alone. “Kinda wish your friend could’ve made it here <i>after</i> that point, then.”</p>
<p>There was silence, as Firn turned to the older astronaut with an uncertain look. Hal’s voice soon pulled them out of their thoughts: <span class=radio>“…Ah, uh… Yeah, Firn? Please don’t be too hard on them if they’re still, uh. Putting things back in order.”</span></p>
<p>“Putting <i>what</i> in order?” Firn frowned. “Their brain?”</p>
<p class=radio>“…Sort of…? —Look, Hornfels, I <i>know</i> how crazy this sounds, okay? You don’t need to tell me that it’s not <i>normal</i> to feel like you’re living through two different moments at the same time, and it sure isn’t fun trying to hold a conversation when you’re <i>already</i> having another conversation happening inside your head at the same time.”</p>
<p>Firn kept their silence once again, struggling to believe it, yet also now accepting the fact that two Hearthians had separately developed the same symptoms from the same experience on two different planets, and that what Hal had just described provided a reasonable enough explanation for their earlier behavior in the statue room.</p>
<p>“Yeah, now we really <i>have</i> to investigate these statues and where they came from,” they still stated gravely. Then, with another glance at the hammock: “…as soon as Gabbro’s up for it, I guess. Hope it won’t take long.”</p>
<p>“Mneh, you can just go without me,” the astronaut in question waved with a tired hand before they once again brought their flute to their helmet. “Knowing you, I’d just slow you down even if I were in top form.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Hornfels instantly disagreed with this mindset. <span class=radio>“Gabbro, this is Firn’s <i>first launch</i>, and they chose as their first destination a planet filled with thunder, a raging ocean with drifting islands which render any attempts at mapping it futile, and <i>cyclones</i>. Having an experienced astronaut to keep an eye on them will prove extremely valuable, all the more when you <i>already have</i> visited the place they intend to investigate.”</span></p>
<p>Firn grunted under their breath. They were hoping that ground control would rather put an emphasis on the latter half of that argument and skip the patronizing part.</p>
<p>Gabbro begrudgingly put the flute down, letting it rest on their chest for a while. “Fine. You’re the boss, Horns.” Their helmet turned to Firn: “Think you can turn down the signalscope and get prepared now. Will join you in a sec.”</p>
<p>But they did not move a muscle. Firn stared, then crossed their arms. Their finger started tapping their elbow again. They tried to keep in mind Hal’s words about giving them some space and quiet, and decided to grant Gabbro the same patience they had given Hal when it had been their turn to momentarily shut them down.</p>
<p>Then, finally, after a long pause: “…Okay, I think I’m good. Emphasis on <i>think</i>.”</p>
<p>And with a tired sigh, Gabbro sat up and unceremoniously threw their legs over the hammock, jumping down and letting their knees bounce down and back up as they landed, evidently well-practiced in the arts of dealing with the increased gravity and knowing how to efficiently cushion the strain on their legs.</p>
<p>Firn watched as the older astronaut set their flute inside the hammock, gave it a little pat, and took advantage of their momentarily free hands to stretch. “So, while you’re getting ready,” they questioned with their impatient finger still tapping ever faster, “where do you think we should investigate? Did you also fish your other statue from the ocean, or was it standing somewhere specific?”</p>
<p>“Somewhere specific,” Gabbro answered without hesitation as they stopped walking towards their jetpack and raised their head high up, looking around and over the horizon. “Let’s see if it’s still… A<i>ha</i>.” They pointed at a different island, and Firn squinted as they tried to take in its dual shape, blurred by the distance and the fog in-between. “My statue was on the beach of that island. It was practically a jump away when I decided to go take a quick look, but then my island was tossed up in space soon after I was back, and…”</p>
<p>Firn’s mouth gaped. “You said you found that statue like, <i>ten minutes ago</i>,” they heaved in shock, “and it’s already <i>that</i> far away!?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well,” there was a huff as they tightened their jetpack’s belt, “the current’s pretty strong, in case you hadn’t noticed. Islands drift apart and into each other all the time. Kinda why we gave up on trying to chart the planet.”</p>
<p>With their jetpack now firmly in place, Gabbro then turned to their hammock and reached out; but before they could pick up their trusty companion, Firn’s arm grabbed theirs from behind their back and pulled away.</p>
<p>From under their visor, Gabbro’s eyes widened in sudden haste. “Wait, my flute–!”</p>
<p>“—isn’t going anywhere,” the cadet interrupted while tugging with even more force, “so let’s launch before that island gets any further!”</p>
<p>And with that, Gabbro found themself dragged away from their hammock and soon right into the beam of Firn’s ship, with the new astronaut closing the hatch a second after their landing inside, and then jumping straight into the pilot’s seat before they even had the time to blink.</p>
<p>At least there was oxygen in there. Gabbro removed their helmet and gladly let their gloved hand run through their entire face, thankful at least that this small ship’s walls protected them all at once from the rain, the roar of the wind, and the risk of running out of breathable air any second a cyclone would feel moody.</p>
<p>And then, the moment later the ship took off, and despite the gravity crystal being perfectly intact, Gabbro was taken off-guard and fell flat on their face with a pained grunt. Their first fully headache-free thought was something related to the fact that they were pretty sure that ‘hatchling-sitting’ was not on their job resume.</p>
<p>This was going to be a <i>long</i> day.</p>

<!-- @SFOLD — 001 — CHAP. 3:  The Rock That Looks Like a Face Rock -->
<div class=chp id=ch3_1><h1>Chapter 3</h1><h2>The Rock That Looks Like a Face Rock</h2><hr>
<p>In the defense of the newest astronaut to enter the Outer Wilds Ventures program: out of all astral bodies in their entire solar system, Giant’s Deep clearly was on the lowest tier in terms of orientation and flight maneuverability. Dark Bramble set aside for reasons that none needed to elaborate, a close second would likely be Ember Twin, and that would be solely if you were enough of a lunatic to deliberately bring your ship down inside the equatorial canyon and play tag with the column of sand.</p>
<p>In comparison, Brittle Hollow was a cinch as long as you could look out for the Lantern’s constant but predictable and relatively tranquil clouds of falling ash (it was only recently that a note from Riebeck mentioned that it had started spouting actual blobs of lava at the planet, but such spike in the moon’s volcanic activity had still gone largely undocumented given the fact that it was barely a few days old) and were not crazy enough to try and <i>fly</i> a ship <i>underground</i>. Provided you could even find a hole big enough to fit it through the crust, that was.</p>
<p class=vs>And finally, good old Timber Hearth was more or less out of competition for ‘Rutile has threatened to shut down the program if any astronaut were to dare fly too close to the village while in low altitude for any purpose other than launching or landing’ reasons. The only other difficulty that could be noted with this planet would be the geysers, but it simply was a matter of keeping an eye on the ground and looking out for their locations in order to very simply <i>not fly right on top of them like a</i>…</p>
<p>…Well, there was a reason why the Hearthian language had many generations ago come up with the term ‘geyser-jumper.’</p>
<p>And so, yes. There was not that much competition to begin with, granted, but this did not change the fact that <i>usually</i>, when looking at the recommended order in which a still-learning astronaut should visit the outer wilds’ various planets… Giant’s Deep was pretty close to the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>This planet was two things: powerful enough to hijack your ship from the outside, and dangerously unpredictable. It went without saying that this did not amount to a very beginner-friendly combination.</p>
<p>Again, Gabbro had to hand it to the newest astronaut: despite the giant’s constant mood swings throwing their ship around like a disgruntled hatchling would kick pebbles into ponds at the smallest inconvenience, Firn was doing a surprisingly fine job not falling into panic. Perhaps because they were already too busy falling into anger instead.</p>
<p>It was unfortuntae, but… Gabbro could not in good conscience refer to their piloting as ‘cut out for the job.’ Their constant tendency to overcompensate, fighting against the rain and winds for control instead of letting them guide their hand towards an alternate path, showed their definite lack of field experience; and if the raging gales had anything to say about it, patience and compliance were precisely what this planet demanded from its visitors.</p>
<p>It was a shame that any time Gabbro tried to approach a hand to the controls for a slight and smooth adjustment to what was going to be a rocky trajectory change a second later, it was instantly slapped away without a second thought.</p>
<p class=vs>To be fair, Firn <i>had</i> been promised a first solo launch. It wouldn’t be much of a ‘solo’ if they were just going to act like a surrogate Gossan, and nobody enjoyed being on the receiving end of broken promises.</p>
<p>…Even though their barely recovering brain was now stuck pondering how it was even possible to feel this many tremors from inside the ship, when this was precisely what the gravity crystal was meant to mitigate down to nonexistence.</p>
<p>Another cyclone almost threw them into orbit, Firn barely succeeding in escaping its pull at the last second, but the force of nature had nonetheless managed to tilt their altitude upwards enough to momentarily make them kiss the clouds. For perhaps the twelfth time or so since they had embarked and launched, Gabbro heard the young cadet grit their teeth and grunt at the frustration of losing control of their own ship — at the frustration that they so dearly wished they could keep pretending to be more competent than they truly were.</p>
<p>Gossan had given them the permission to go, that was for certain, and Firn’s piloting skills did show that they had everything down theory-wise, memorized and perfected, ready to jump into practice. This level of skill was definitely enough for a first launch to go smoothly… had they stuck to the original plan of simply following the same schedule as every first launch: landing on the Attlerock, roasting a mallow or two with Esker, and then having some mindless fun walking around in low gravity.</p>
<p class=vs>All in all: Firn surely would make for a great pilot, someday. They simply needed practice.</p>
<p>A <i>lot</i> more practice.</p>
<p>Firn glanced down with concern at the thick and opaque upper atmosphere blocking all sunlight from view — glancing down indeed, as this occurred during a fleeting second when their ship happened to be upside down. After a short seething inhale, they asked: “Should we be worried about that storm?”</p>
<p><i>Not nearly as much as the likelihood of your piloting sending us straight into the nearest island sooner or later</i>, Gabbro did not say. Instead, with a light unbothered shrug: “Eh. Not really. I’ve yet to see any bolt reaching down, they tend to stay up there doing their thing from within the clouds. And even when you’re in there, it doesn’t seem like they’re interested in hitting our ships,” they explained nonchalantly. “The real danger you’ll want to look out for are the cyclones, but—”</p>
<p>“I’m <i>already aware</i> of the cyclones, <i>thank you very much</i>.”</p>
<p>“—Yeah, was about to say. Pretty hard to miss.”</p>
<hr>
<p>It took much longer than both astronauts would have preferred, but Firn eventually managed to catch up with the island they were looking for, with Gabbro confirming that it was indeed the right one. It wasn’t long before they spotted the glow of a gravity beam, radiating off the ground from what appeared from afar to be a circular platform. The young cadet went straight for it without hesitation, relieved to finally find something in the wildness of this planet that would hopefully reveal itself to be <i>helpful</i> — disregarding the fact that this Nomai construct was, by definition, not truly part of the ‘wildness’ per se.</p>
<p>The sudden pull took Firn by surprise, far more than they would ever want to admit. The angle at which they had brought their ship to it was close enough to verticality that both astronauts feared for a moment that the artificial gravity would pull them to the ground upside-down; but thankfully, despite landing only half of the ship on the pad and the other half on the beach, resulting in a noticeable and uncomfortable tilt, this was overall an acceptable success.</p>
<p>A second later, the clicking of unbuckling resounded, and yet another second later, Firn was pushing Gabbro to the side, opening the hatch, and jumping down, this time being more mindful of the strain the giant’s gravity would subject their legs to. By the time Gabbro jumped down after them, the hatchling was already three dozen meters away and not showing any signs of stopping, as they had instantly noticed amongst the rocks and sand what appeared to be a flight of stairs.</p>
<p>“Slow down, buddy,” Gabbro called out into their radio, only for their tired request to be royally ignored.</p>
<p>Hardly turning around for a split second, Firn’s only response was to retort “Wanna figure out what happened to you and Hal or not!?”</p>
<p>With a sigh, Gabbro gave up on trying to remind them that their impatience and enthusiasm should not prevent them from keeping an eye on their resource levels. Fearing that they would soon lose sight of them, the older astronaut was forced into a little jog — refusing to go any faster than that. Just walking on this planet was supposed to be exercise enough, thank you; not to mention that more exercise was also synonym to an increased oxygen consumption.</p>
<p class=vs>Firn climbed eons old stairs, walked along a clearly set path that the Nomai had undoubtedly constructed and followed long before them… and soon faced a broken bridge across the ocean.</p>
<p>Brilliant as they were, even the Nomai could not defy nature for this long. It truly should be unsurprising that time had taken a toll on their architecture and machines; and in fact, it should have been far more surprising that the damage was ultimately so limited — almost as surprising as the sturdiness of trees in outer space, and their inherent resistance to ship thrusters and atmosphere reentry despite their innate property of being flammable.</p>
<p>Firn walked up to the edge, looking down into the rather intimidating drop, then assessing the distance between them and the closest part of debris they could hope to reach. They were now all too aware of the increased gravity’s impact on their movements, and expected its effects to reach out to their jetpack as well; it was fortunate that their brand new suit came with a fuel tank filled to the brim.</p>
<p>They took a few steps backwards, carefully calculating their next actions all the while, then decided to walk all the way to the other end of their platform for good measure. And then, just as Gabbro’s head was peeking over from behind their back, they darted forward without hesitation and activated their thrusters at full force the moment they reached the edge, jumping as high and far as they could, and preparing themself for a heavy landing on the other side.</p>
<p class=vs>They made their jump, landing almost at the center of the other platform, and took a second to press their hands on their knees and take a breath, mentally patting themself on the back for this little achievement. They stopped panting after a few seconds, and raised their head again to look forward…</p>
<p>…only to notice that there was another gap to cross. With a groan, their eyes immediately fell right to the ground once more.</p>
<p>Gabbro landed next to them with the grace of years of practice and experience, gave them a little pat on the back — a real one this time, with the tiniest wordless snicker to boot — before taking the next leap and landing on the other half of the island, waving at them from there.</p>
<p>In this moment, Firn decided that Giant’s Deep <i>sucked</i>.</p>
<hr>
<p>When Firn made their second jump, Gabbro had turned their back to them. They had decided to wait for them by standing in the same position as they had just a dozen of minutes or two earlier, transfixed by the same sight they had witnessed then — by the statue which had, technically speaking, pretty much assaulted their mind without permission or warning. Just like the previous time, it was lying in the sand, motionless and half buried in it, only difference being its now fully open eyes looking vacantly at both nothing and everything.</p>
<p>“So that’s the one that opened its eyes at you,” the young cadet asserted, nodding at their own words with confidence.</p>
<p>An accurate guess, not to difficult to conclude from the context and clues lying around; still, Gabbro nodded and hummed in return, thinking that they would nonetheless appreciate the external confirmation.</p>
<p>Gabbro caught the sight of some shuffling around in the corner of their upper eye, and when they turned to look at Firn again, they had started to make their way closer to the statue, scout launcher in hand. There were a couple bright flashes of light as they used the photo mode all around, at both the statue and its surroundings, from all relevant sides they could think of. Many photos were taken with little to no pause in-between them, with Firn stopping only once or twice overall when it appeared that the result displayed on their helmet’s <span class=scaps>hud</span> gave a satisfying angle.</p>
<p>A dozen seconds later, and Firn lost interest in the statue, turning instead to the carved cliff to their right — and more specifically, to a small pillar with what appeared to be some Nomai writings carved on its top, standing beside a closed door of sorts.</p>
<p class=vs>In silence, Gabbro had a double take, blinking a few times as they took just a few steps closer to the epigraph. Was that wiggly spiral glowing the last time they were here?</p>
<p class=vs>Whatever the case, Firn did not seem surprised by it. They simply pulled out a shiny new tool which certainly had to be that translator they and Hal had been working so hard on perfecting up to the last time Gabbro had visited Timber Hearth, and they pointed it at the carving without a word.</p>
<p>A few fancy lasers came out to scan multiple spots at once, soon displaying a short text on the tiny screen; and with another confused blink and a pair of raised eyebrows, Gabbro noticed that the glow had partially faded in response. Weird. Also kind of weird that Firn paid it no mind, but chances were that they simply were used to it, what with the whole thing around having built the device to begin with and all that.</p>
<p>At any rate, the scout launcher was out a few seconds later, and again there were a couple of pictures taken. Then, the cadet turned to them and, for lack of being able to cross their arms because of the bulky equipment keeping one of them busy, Firn opted instead for gluing their free hand to their hip. Their index finger instantly started tapping against it.</p>
<p>“So,” they said decisively, breaking the silence at once. “The sign reads ‘Statue Workshop.’ That sounds encouraging.” They turned their head to the door, adding flatly: “Except the path is blocked, because of course it is.”</p>
<p>Gabbro took a few relaxed steps forward, nodding. “Yeah, I think it’s one of those Nomai airlocks. As you can tell, that one’s busted.” They watched as the new astronaut, undeterred, walked forward anyway and scratched at the edges of the stone, if only to try and see if they could take a peek at the other side; and after a few seconds, Gabbro shook their head and sighed. “Good luck trying to pry it open by force when it weighs twice the amount it already would on Timber Hearth, buddy. If you get squashed, I’m not pulling you out from under it.”</p>
<p>Firn let go and turned around, all four rolling eyes somehow radiating even past their visor. “I&nbsp;wasn’t gonna.”</p>
<p>“You were considering it.”</p>
<p>The hatchling let a grunt resonate inside their throat, but decided to drop both this conversation topic and their grip on the wall cracks. Instead, they reached for their signalscope and pointed it upwards:</p>
<p>“Hal,” they called out, “are you still there?”</p>
<p>Their radio picked up an almost simultaneous mixture of <i><span class=radio>“Firn! Hi again!”</span></i> and <i><span class=radio>“We can hear you loud and clear, Firn.”</span></i> The cadet repressed a tiny chuckle at the ground control’s enthusiasm.</p>
<p><span class=radio>“I must take it that you and Gabbro landed safely on this other island?”</span> Hornfels added immediately, still keeping some barely audible traces of worry and likely trying to pretend that they had not spent the whole time hoping for a crash-less day.</p>
<p><span class=radio>“You’ve found something interesting?”</span> Hal asked right after, voice brimming with hope and excitement.</p>
<p>“Hey, hey, one at a time,” Firn snickered. “Yes we made it there, and yes we’ve got some news — kinda disappointing, though. Gabbro’s statue is right in front of an airlock, and the room behind it should give a ton of info about how they were made, and maybe what they were for.”</p>
<p>The radio seemed to transmit what had to be a barely audible murmur of confusion, before Hal could be heard again: <span class=radio>“Wait, those are <i>good</i> news. What’s the catch?”</span></p>
<p>“Airlock’s broken. Gotta find another way in.”</p>
<p class=radio>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Talk to you later.”</p>
<p>Firn then put away the signalscope and readied their scout launcher. Sending one last glance at the broken but far too sturdy wall, they then scanned the rest of their surroundings down to the smallest branch of coral they could see, looking for something else to continue investigating. Alas, it appeared that there was nothing more to find on this beach which could be of any use.</p>
<p>“Come on,” they soon instructed to Gabbro, with a tilt of their head pointing towards what seemed to be a path up the cliff lined up with gravity crystals, and their feet soon following their own advice. “There’s got to be another entrance somewhere.”</p>
<p>With a heavy jump coming off with an audible <i>oomph</i> and a powerful upwards thrust of their jetpack which was completely unnecessary if Gabbro had anything to say about it, Firn soon landed on the vertical surface surrounding the nearest gravity crystal, then turned around briefly to insistently repeat their command, waiting for the other Hearthian to follow in their trail.</p>
<p>Both explorers cautiously followed the path in silence — or, well, almost in silence:</p>
<p>“New entry: Giant’s Deep. Statue isla̷͗ͅn̷̞͠ḋ̶͈̺ ”</p>
<p>If Gabbro had been startled by the unexpected words that were evidently not directed at them, they were even more surprised by the abrupt ending. Perking their head up towards Firn’s in a slight hurry, as theirs had been the voice to utter what they had just heard, they instantly noticed that the young cadet’s hand was tinkering with the base of their helmet’s aerial and that they had just turned off their radio; and when Gabbro gave a tentative tap on their shoulder, the hatchling’s reaction was to give them a dismissive wave and accelerate their pace. Their radio being turned off mid-sentence explained what they had just heard, and the body language along with the fact that Firn started walking away from them confirmed that it was intentional.</p>
<p class=vs>The elder astronaut’s curiosity was piqued. Walking closer nonetheless (if only because they were following the same narrow path anyway), listening in this time not through the radio, but through the thickness of two helmets and a stormy atmosphere, Gabbro could almost associate the movement of their lips with concise and specific words. They could almost catch a whole sentence, thinking that what Firn said must have been something along the lines of <i>“…used to lead inside the island.”</i></p>
<p>And then Firn raised the same hand to their helmet again. With the flick of a finger against the same button at the base of their aerial, their radio was turned back on; and along with the many connections it brought back, was the connection with their ship and the order to save the new file which had just been created. They gave a satisfied hum when their <span class=scaps>hud</span> displayed the words ‘<span class=scaps>ship log updated</span>.’</p>
<p class=vs>The elders and not-so-elders all had a lot of gripes with a lot of things regarding Firn’s general attitude; but one thing they could not ignore, and one of the main reasons that got them into the program along with their invaluable contribution in helping Hal make the Nomai translator a reality, was the fact that Firn was exceptionally thorough and methodical.</p>
<p>They were a sarcastic brat who questioned authority more often than they listened to their answers, they were dangerously reckless, they were obnoxiously stubborn; but when it was about exploring the outer wilds and piecing together the mysteries their solar system harbored, they were taking the matter with the utmost solemnity. Where Hearthian society had failed to teach them respect, the universe itself had by proving to them how small of a pebble they all were, floating in the vastness of a whole lot of nothing.</p>
<p>Now finished with their note-taking, Firn turned to them and gave a sheepish laugh. “My bad, I almost forgot to mute my transmitter. Didn’t want to bother you with my ramblings.”</p>
<p>“Turning off your radio is dangerous,” Gabbro warned, “even if it’s temporary. Why did you feel the need to do that?”</p>
<p>“Can’t risk having someone else speak through my comms while I’m editing,” they mumbled with a shrug, “that’d mess up the whole entry.” They marked a pause, noticing that the trail of gravity crystals had ended and led to an open path back to horizontality, and therefore to the regular definitions of up and down. With another jump and, again, far too much fuel being burned for such a tiny leap in Gabbro’s personal opinion, Firn landed on the exposed path and continued their walk. Then, they resumed: “Also, it helps me focus.”</p>
<p>Gabbro left the gravity crystal trail in turn, simply by stretching a laid-back leg away from the vertical path and planting it on the horizontal one, and then repeating those steps with their other one with just as much nonchalance. All the while, they gave a light hum and nod. “And then you turn it back on to send the file to your ship.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh. All I have to do after that is turn on the computer and profit.”</p>
<p>Gabbro blew an impressed whistle. “Slate sure got you spoiled with all those fancy gadgets.”</p>
<p>Firn’s laugh was this time an unrestrained bark of excitement and mock-offense. “Hey, the coding part was all me! Slate didn’t want to show me how they programmed the autopilot, and I’m pretty sure it’s ‘cause they were jealous, heh.”</p>
<p>They raised a surprised eyebrow. “Wait, really?”</p>
<p>“Yep! It was a bit last minute and they were reluctant at first, but in the end they let me include some work of mine for the ship log. Text-to-speech was a prototype upgrade I was thinking about for the translator, but when I offered Hal to use their voice for the database, they said it wasn’t necessary, so, <i>oh well</i>. Reversed the whole thing and got it added to my ship instead. Been wanting to make sure I’d be able to write log entries even when I have my hands full, and now that we’re here…” They let their tirade trail off and blend into a smug snicker full of pride. “Heh, I’m gonna have <i>so</i> much fun with that featu—”</p>
<p>Firn was not given the chance to finish their sentence.</p>
<p>It started with the wind picking up at once, sweeping them to the side with a violence far too fierce and sudden for them to resist. It was only thanks to their quick thinking in using their downward thrusters that Firn managed, for a few seconds at least, to maintain their feet glued to the ground and not fall over the cliff entirely. These same few seconds had them simultaneously busy with putting their scout launcher away in order to free their hands, but to their dismay, they had already been pushed too far from the rock wall to be able to reach for it and take a grip — not that there was much of a grip to take in the first place.</p>
<p><i>“Uh oh”</i> were the only words Gabbro uttered into their radio, both cryptic and unhelpful, as they realized the reason why neither of them had seen it coming: the large cyclone which was currently thinking about swallowing them whole had been treacherously coming to them from the other side of the island — a perfect blind spot.</p>
<p>Before Firn could process what was even happening, they fell to their knees as the ground shook and rose at high speed, feeling crushed under a doubled gravity which, because of the upwards acceleration, had been multiplied even further. Against their better judgement, Firn screamed.</p>
<p>“Firn! Buddy!”</p>
<p>Gabbro may as well have been coming up with actual advice by this point; but despite their efforts, Firn’s flattened and buzzing ears heard none of it, and with their four eyes shut tight, the hatchling was blind to the fact that they were trying to slowly crawl to their side and reach out for their hand. Gabbro was too slow for the latter step to be successful.</p>
<p>Wind turned to silence, green turned to black.</p>
<p class=vs>Going in an instant from quadrupled gravity to none, feeling solid ground evade their feet and hands and knees, seeing it grow smaller, then bigger and bigger, ready to collide with their face, Firn flailed about helplessly. Too disoriented to pay attention to the voice in their receiver, they only had a split second to finally notice Gabbro reaching out for their hand, only to immediately after see their faraway blurry figure get accidentally kicked in the ribs and sent flying dozens of meters away and up in the air by their own panicking limbs.</p>
<p>With a gasp of guilt and panic, Firn flared up their thrusters at full power to catch up after them, only to forget that during these few seconds, the gravity they had to fight against was no longer twice that of Timber Hearth, but falsely nonexistent — and further than this, that any momentum they were to gain from then on was not so easily subsided.</p>
<p>They collided with Gabbro, hard. With an <i>“Oomph”</i> and a <i>“Firn, wait—”</i> which entered one of Firn’s ears only to instantly come out the other, Gabbro was flung even further away in the process. In trying to catch up again and reach out to them with continuously growing panic and an equally continuous trail of <i>“Sorry!”</i>, Firn’s grip on the joystick controlling their jetpack came loose. In turning their head violently in order to find and catch it again, their whole body started rotating uncontrollably into the vast void of space.</p>
<p>And then, finally, Gabbro blasted their way to them with a single calculated thrust of minimal force, succeeding in slowing down enough to avoid collision this time, and grabbed their leg. In a matter of a few dozen seconds, both astronauts were back at eye level again, standing upright again relatively to each other, and…</p>
<p>…far up in orbit, at a high enough altitude to see Giant’s Deep’s curvature.</p>
<p>The island they had been investigating, briefly turned into a lift straight up to space, was nowhere to be seen. It had most likely already made its way back to the surface, back to floating like a buoy, following the whims and fancies of the planet’s flows and currents.</p>
<p class=vs>Gabbro brought a hand to the side of their helmet and, orienting their visor towards Giant’s Deep, they locked on to it… Yep, they were pretty far up.</p>
<p>Judging by the velocity displayed on their <span class=scaps>hud</span>, they had embarked on a very, very slow descent, following the nearby gravitational pull; but if Gabbro’s estimations were to be trusted and no island were to coincidentally come to them in the meantime, they would both have ample time to die through suffocation long before they would through colliding with the ocean. Maybe even twice over.</p>
<p>Gabbro clicked their tongue, reaching for their signalscope. “…Okay. Maybe we’re in a little bit of trouble.”</p>
<p>Firn turned their visor away from the sight of the planet and towards their face, eyes wide. “A&nbsp;<i><span class=scaps>little bit</span>!?</i>” they exploded.</p>
<p>“Tone it down, radio’s picking up your voice just fine.” They only needed to adjust the frequency, find where to aim, and… “Um. Hornfels? You still here?”</p>
<p>There were a few seconds of silence; but soon, the receiver crackled with static and worry. <span class=radio>“We can hear you, Gabbro, and I am not liking this tone. What happened?”</span></p>
<p>“Yeah, well…” the older astronaut sighed, trying to explain their predicament to a Hearthian who did not have the luxury of seeing what they were currently looking at. “Giant’s Deep has a lot of cyclones, you know? And they’re powerful enough to pull out entire islands right into space for a few moments. Happens sometimes.”</p>
<p>“Only <i>‘sometimes’</i>!?” Firn parroted with a deadpan look and a nearly hysterical shriek brimming with sarcasm. “I’ve been here for less than a half sunrise and the whole <i>planet</i> already kicked me out!”</p>
<p>Hal’s voice resonated nervously: <span class=radio>“I’m… I’m not sure I understand. You were kicked out of…? What’s going on?”</span></p>
<p>Judging from the volume of their voice slowly decreasing near the end, it seemed like they were gently pushed away from the ground control desk’s microphone. And indeed, Hornfels soon took over instead, tone sharp and straight to the point: <span class=radio>“Gabbro, just tell us where you are. What is your current position?”</span></p>
<p>“…About sixteen kilometers from the center of mass. Currently in orbit.”</p>
<p>With Giant’s Deep’s water surface standing on average at a radius of roughly five kilometers, this meant that this would be more than a whole ten kilometers drop. From this height and accounting for the increased gravity, even landing in water would likely be enough to cause at the very least a severe concussion; and being concussed while floating in the middle of a raging ocean was begging for the universe to end their life with slow and painful drowning, not even accounting for the chance of cyclones picking them up and flinging them around a few more times for good measure.</p>
<p>Hornfels let out a grunt filled with frustration and concern. <span class=radio>“Fuel and oxygen?”</span></p>
<p>There was a second of heavy silence. “Bad.”</p>
<p class=radio>“Gabbro. I want <i>numbers</i>.”</p>
<p>There was an inhale through Gabbro’s nose audible enough to make it through their transmitter. “Twenty-one percent fuel, fifty-three minutes oxygen,” they relented tensely. They knew they had forgotten something when leaving camp (well, one of two things, really, but only one of the two was because of their own negligence), and that something had been to refuel their jetpack. Turning their helmet towards their fellow astronaut, they gave an inquisitive nod: “Firn?”</p>
<p>Gabbro could almost hear the hatchling’s lips trembling before they spoke. “…S-six percent, forty-five minutes.”</p>
<p>A few seconds of muffled swearing crackled through the radio. Then:</p>
<p class=radio>“Stay right where you are. Await instructions.”</p>
<p>“Not much of a choice,” Gabbro shrugged before lowering their signalscope.</p>
<hr>
<p>To say that Hal was panicking would be an understatement.</p>
<p class=vs>The moment Hornfels had pressed a button likely meant to deafen (but not mute) their connection to Firn and Gabbro’s radios, the tall Hearthian started dashing around the observatory, looking at charts and more parts of the many screens and buttons on their dashboard, and Hal was struggling to find any place where they could stand and have their panic attack in silence without being an obstacle to their work.</p>
<p>There was nothing they could do. They hardly understood what was happening, Hornfels’ actions were swift and precise and full of a meaning that they had never seen or learned. Hal so desperately wanted to help, but they had no clue how; and with no purpose or knowledge to grasp, only fear remained.</p>
<p class=vs>Hornfels ran to the model of the solar system standing at the edge of the staircase, and pulling a measuring tape out of their pocket, they inched closer to the moving spheres and assessed some distances. The model had been crafted to be to scale, and thanks to the Deep Space Satellite and some quite brilliant work from Slate, the relative positions of each tiny replica were calculated to reflect those of the actual astral bodies in real time.</p>
<p>Sadly, the current alignments Hornfels could see were far from ideal. Both Timber Hearth and the Hourglass Twins were standing opposite to Giant’s Deep, as far away from it as they possibly could get — and with this, it was clear that they did not have enough time to even consider them as options.</p>
<p class=vs>Which left…</p>
<p>Well, the good news was, this planet was on the other hand as close to their target as it could possibly be.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hornfels brought a hand to rub their nose bridge and took a deep inhale. This was not going to be easy.</p>
<p>They stood up and swiftly turned to their dashboard, only to see a hatchling standing right next to the controls; without thinking, they started to call out for their help: “Hal, give me—” But the next second, their eyes met with their distraught and terrified face, and they remembered that the poor thing had no idea how any part of this apparatus worked. “Never mind, just let me through.”</p>
<p>Hal staggered away from the desk as Hornfels pounced on it, and with a few swift button presses, a connection was established with Brittle Hollow. Instantly, the calming notes of a banjo resonated in the room, instilling an unwelcome eeriness due to the unexpected contrast with the ambient feel of urgency.</p>
<p>“Ground Control to Riebeck,” they reached out with a surprisingly steady voice, “do you copy?”</p>
<p>The music’s volume slightly lowered and slowed down, but did not fully stop. Soon came a cheerful greeting: <span class=radio>“Oh, Hornfels! Hello!”</span></p>
<p>“I fear the circumstances are far from ideal, and we do not have much time,” they continued, trying to find the best way to summarize the situation as concisely as they could. “Gabbro and Firn are stranded in orbit around Giant’s Deep, with no ship or fuel, and we have barely forty minutes before they run out of oxygen.”</p>
<p>A timid, uninvited yelp went to complete the harmony of their tune, ending the melody on an abrupt note. <span class=radio>“A-a-and you want <i>me</i> to rescue them!? Hornfels, I’m sure we both want them to be <i>rescued</i>, not to end up with a third stranded astronaut! Where do I even land my ship? What if I c-<i>crash</i> into something somehow and kill them? Along with myself!?”</span></p>
<p>“Riebeck, you are <i>scared</i>, not <i>incompetent</i>,” Hornfels insisted gravely. “Neither Chert nor Esker could arrive before they start suffocating. Brittle Hollow is currently the closest planet to Giant’s Deep, you are the only one who can make it in time.”</p>
<p>There were more ruffling sounds. This time, none of them could be identified as a banjo string being plucked. <span class=radio>“O-okay. Okay. I’m— I’m coming. T-t-tell them to hang on tight. <span class=smol>…Ooh, why did I leave my ship on the south pole…</span>”</span> And as the sounds of quick pacing were picked up by the receiver, followed by a low gravity attempt at running, Riebeck added: <span class=radio>“I have a spare tank of oxygen here, and I think my ship has one or two more. Also fuel for their jetpacks. Just in case.”</span></p>
<p>“That should be more than enough,” Hornfels nodded. “Thank you, Riebeck.”</p>
<p class=radio>“But, Hornfels— H-how am I even going to find them? We can play in any atmosphere, but we still need at least <i>some</i> air, no? There’s nothing to play with if they’re in orbit! Can my signalscope even detect them?”</p>
<p>Hornfels bit their lip. Admittedly, they did not know the answer to that question, as they had yet to recall any occurrence where one of the travelers would attempt to play anywhere other than at their camp, safely sitting around a cozy fire burning in a well-maintained pocket of breathable air created by their good old pine trees.</p>
<p>“…We’ll figure something out. Just focus on making it to your ship as fast as you can.”</p>
<p><span class=radio>“G-got it.”</span> There were a few seconds of heavy breathing, likely caused by the archeologist’s hurried pace. Then: <span class=radio>“Wish me luck. We’re all going to need it.”</span></p>
<hr>
<p class=vs>Firn looked down at the tumultuous clouds twirling below their feet from afar. The sight sure was terrifying, albeit quite impressively beautiful, too.</p>
<p>Still, aesthetic was not what the young cadet had been looking for.</p>
<p>“We’ve still got <i>some</i> fuel left. Can’t we just… try giving a small boost downwards and landing on Giant’s Deep again? That’ll be a big plunge, but it sounds better than staying in orbit. Both our ships are down there anyway.”</p>
<p>Gabbro crossed their arms and sighed.</p>
<p>“If you want to gamble and think we’ll somehow be lucky enough to land <i>in water</i> rather than directly crash on land, to not be taken by <i>another</i> cyclone right after, to <i>somehow</i> be close enough to my camp so we can swim to the trees and refill, <i>without</i> using our jetpacks, and <i>before</i> we suffocate,” they detailed, raising one finger at each condition necessary for their survival to be even remotely conceivable (and uncrossing their arms as soon as they realized that one hand would not be enough), “then yes. Maybe. That’s one plan, I guess, but I really don’t like our chances.”</p>
<p>Firn gave a sarcastic huff. “And you think we have better chances staying up here till our oxygen runs out?”</p>
<p>Before Gabbro could respond, the sound of static finally came back through their receivers. <span class=radio>“Riebeck is on their way, their ship should be in view in about thirty minutes,”</span> Hornfels’ voice soon rang out sharply. <span class=radio>“Stay put and focus on saving your resources.”</span></p>
<p class=vs>Firn’s arms dropped to their sides as they simply stared in disappointed shock. The visor made it impossible to see their face, but Gabbro’s head tilt in their direction made it quite clear that they just <i>had</i> to be giving them a smug, patronizing expression.</p>
<p><i>‘And that’s how you do it the Gabbro way, rookie,’</i> Firn could picture in their mind. Ah, yes, of course, the Gabbro way: making others do all the work in your stead.</p>
<p>“So— are we <i>really</i> just gonna— stay like this and do <i>nothing!?</i>”</p>
<p>“It’s just thirty minutes, buddy, it’s not the end of the world.”</p>
<p class=vs>Not the end of the world, but definitely the end of their patience.</p>
<p>There <i>had</i> to be something to do, and they would get that something done — if only out of childish spite.</p>
<p>With a sudden flash of inspiration, Firn gasped: “Gabbro, can’t you use your flute for Riebeck to pick up on?”</p>
<p>Gabbro raised their hands and showed their palms, both empty. “What flute? You didn’t let me take it when we left camp.”</p>
<p>After a long second of silence, Firn momentarily felt a great urge to slam their helmet against an open palm. Before they could act upon it, however, the full gravity of the situation fell upon them; and thus, only their chilling remorse was expressed. “…Right. Sorry. Not my brightest moment.”</p>
<p>And so, defeated, the cadet looked down in shame and regret.</p>
<p>Their first trip should have been exciting. Their first trip should have been all about exploring space and translating words that no Hearthian had ever read before.</p>
<p>Their first trip should have been about proving that they were <i>competent</i>.</p>
<p>But they had barely gotten started on solving the mystery of the statues, and the planet itself had laughed in their face.</p>
<hr>
<p>It was a well known fact amongst the village that Firn was neither one to contemplate, nor one to surrender. Their four eyes may have been spending the time staring down at Giant’s Deep, their fingers may have been spending the time twitching in impatience, their mouth may have been spending the time trying to chase away all the sass their brain was coming up with, knowing full well that Gabbro was hardly the Hearthian to give satisfying reactions to it.</p>
<p class=vs>But this was time spent bubbling with rage and intent to fight against the boredom and frustration to be <i>asked</i> to stay in place while the <i>adults</i> would fix their mistake, and this was time spent thinking more and more that, after this, no astronaut would trust them to ever go back to space and not turn it into disaster.</p>
<p>This was time spent getting progressively more convinced that, somehow, against the odds, they could still fix this. That they <i>had</i> to fix this.</p>
<p>And so, after a dozen minutes or so which felt like so much longer, Firn spied with their four little eyes… a change. A solution, in the form of a strange apparatus.</p>
<p>They recognized the shape. No Hearthian had figured out what it was, for no astronaut had ever landed on it before, but there was no mistaking it: this massive rocket-like structure was the enigmatic satellite that Outer Wilds Ventures had long spotted orbiting Giant’s Deep.</p>
<p>It was hovering close, less than a kilometer away below their feet, with its orbit faster than theirs by a small margin.</p>
<p>The window of opportunity was small; but only a fool would refuse to take it.</p>
<p>Firn seized Gabbro’s arm without warning and instantly pressed the joystick of their jetpack to blast downwards and to the side, carefully calculating their trajectory.</p>
<p>Gabbro protested loudly, because of course they would; Firn ignored them entirely, just as much as they ignored the tiny message soon displaying at the top of their visor — some kind of warning ending with the word ‘propellant,’ but their eyes were already too focused on their target to pay it any mind.</p>
<p>Less than a minute passed by, and Firn could touch with satisfaction a transparent, broken wall slashed in its center, and see a blurry mess of debris floating on the other side. Only then, as they knew that their velocity was aligned with that of the eons old satellite, did Firn finally pay attention to the astronaut they had dragged along with them; and by paying attention to them, they rather interrupted their objections with a long-overdue, but smug and prideful explanation:</p>
<p>“See? I gave Riebeck a landmark to see from afar! I’m sure this thing’s big enough for their ship to be able to lock on to it too, perhaps even land on it.” Reaching for their signalscope and pointing it outwards, they asserted proudly: “You heard that, Hornfels? I found us a better spot to wait on. Riebeck will have a much easier time finding us now.”</p>
<p>Hornfels sounded like they were choking, and their equally suffocating sentence was far less constructed than was usual for them. <span class=radio>“You did <i>what!?</i>”</span></p>
<p>“That huge thing that orbits Giant’s Deep!” they explained cheerfully. “It’s big, it’s visible from far away, there might even be a way to land a ship on it, and it’s orbiting Giant’s Deep. Hardly changes Riebeck’s plan, it just makes their job easier.”</p>
<p>Turning to the other stranded astronaut to their side, Firn felt like it was their turn to be smug.</p>
<p>Instead, Gabbro’s inexpressive helmet stared right into them, eerily still. “Buddy,” they scolded with what sounded like frozen terror, “your <i>oxygen</i>.”</p>
<p>They froze. Tilting their eyes to the top left corner of their vision, they looked at the tiniest chart displayed on their visor’s screen.</p>
<p>Nineteen minutes left.</p>
<p>Firn heard their breathing more than they ever had before. Had it always been so loud? Was the cloud of condensation forming and vanishing on the glass always there? Was that glass always so thin and close to their face?</p>
<p>“Buddy, you’ll want to calm down if you want to have enough oxygen left by the time Riebeck arrives,” Gabbro advised with an unusually serious tone.</p>
<p>Firn gritted their teeth with a huff. “I <i>know</i> that, I’m not a <i>rookie!</i>” they shouted, taking full offense to what they were certain sounded patronizing.</p>
<p>But then, they realized that they were panting, and that knowing was not enough to actually apply their knowledge to practice. It was now as if they could feel their oxygen run out of their throat, all of it wasted by this stupid body who was breathing too fast to make any good use of it.</p>
<p>They were not even able to follow the most basic rule, the very first one Gossan had taught them, the one about <i>staying calm</i> under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, they were a rookie. They were just a rookie, on their very first launch day, and <i>they were about to die</i>.</p>
<p>“Oh geez. <i>Ooh</i> geez.” Firn grabbed their helmet, as if their hands could pass through the visor and block their mouth, as if this could somehow prevent them from hyperventilating. They had just enough sense left into them to remember that removing it was about the <i>last</i> thing they wanted to do under the current circumstances.</p>
<p>Gabbro seized both of their shoulders, giving a gentle but decisive shake. “Buddy. Look at me. Deep breaths,” they instructed, taking one themself as example. “Deep… breaths. There’s this meditation technique, it’s good for minimizing your oxygen consumption. Follow my lead.”</p>
<p>Firn, miraculously, heard and understood these words. Raising their eyes to look out of the confined space defined by their helmet — which they were certain appeared to be shrinking, with an ever smaller window and a growing darkness surrounding it — they managed to catch the sight of another helmet, and through that other visor, barely visible but still glinting with care, were four other eyes looking back.</p>
<p>Deep breaths. They were asking for deep breaths. Focusing on the breathing which crackled through their radio receiver, rather than on their own, Firn slowly managed to synchronize their rythm.</p>
<p>“You’re doing good, keep at it,” Gabbro assured calmly. “Close your eyes, forget about everything else. You’ll see, rescue will be here before you know it.”</p>
<p>This rhythm had something mesmerizingly soothing to it. With more and more ease as time flew by, Firn let themself lose everything to it; and it was not long before their consciousness faded, letting their mind doze off and wander to temporary nothingness.</p>
<hr>
<p>Riebeck had every right to be exceptionally proud of themself; alas, the urgency of the situation combined with their own fear of space and failure alike, even after they had succeeded, would always prevent them from realizing it.</p>
<p>Gabbro had told Hornfels, and Hornfels had relayed the information to them: they were to search for the two stranded astronauts not by blindly looking for two minuscule black dots standing in front of a roaring green scenery, but for the much larger device orbiting it.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this made the task of finding the two far easier, as the contraption soon became visible even as their ship was standing some fifty kilometers away from the core of Giant’s Deep. On the other, this made the likelihood of crashing into something infinitely larger.</p>
<p>Yet, to the surprise of nobody but themself, landing had been smooth and uneventful — in large part thanks to what Riebeck had soon recognized with unexpected amazement to be a Nomai landing pad.</p>
<p>At first, Riebeck looked down and into the hole: but all they found was a closed Nomai airlock, sign that the astronauts in need of rescue could not be standing on the other side of it.</p>
<p>Gabbro’s indications were extremely helpful in guiding them to their goal; and so, with two tanks of oxygen and fuel under each arm, the archeologist slowly made their way across the structure and towards the side their friends were waiting from.</p>
<p class=vs>As they approached, Riebeck noticed more and more proof that the structure was of Nomai origin, and part of them pondered why no one had ever wanted to explore it; but it was not long before they reasoned that only one astronaut could possibly have been bold enough to attempt it, and… said astronaut had disappeared before they could set their mind on anything other than a planet. The planets had been big and full of discoveries enough on their own, with even so little as the Hanging City being far more to explore than Riebeck could have ever imagined before they could catch sight of it for themself.</p>
<p>Well, that and the fact that the only entrance they had found so far was a closed Nomai airlock. No Hearthian had yet figured out how to open those; it was clear that the spheres embed within stone rails were involved… But just like Hornfels had (according to Hal) spent sleepless weeks trying to pry open the statue’s eyes, never had Riebeck succeeded in getting those spheres to move. Admittedly, because they refused to put in too much force into it for fear of breaking it… But still. Riebeck had long accepted with disappointment that those airlocks might as well be solid, impassable walls.</p>
<p>“Riebeck, over here. Look down and to your left.”</p>
<p>Startling at first at the sound of Gabbro’s voice suddenly brightening their tone, they soon did as asked, and caught sight of an astronaut waving at them from about fifty meters away.</p>
<p>Gabbro was holding something under their arm… Oh dear. Firn’s body looked limp.</p>
<p>“O-oh no, am I too late!?”</p>
<p>“Relax, they’re still breathing,” Gabbro reassured with a soothing voice, but still with some underlying tones of worry which urged Riebeck to hurry. “Showed them some meditation trick. They’re in it <i>deep</i>, who would’ve thought that they’d be so good at it with all the, you know. Firn-ness.” Gabbro decided against specifying out loud that the lowered oxygen pressure inside their suit most likely contributed a lot; Riebeck was bound to panic at the reminder.</p>
<p class=vs>The yellow astronaut finally made their way down to their level, and Gabbro instantly reached out for the tanks under their right arm in order to free it from the burden.</p>
<p>Riebeck tried to reach out for Firn’s oxygen tank, but the fact that they only had one free hand, that Gabbro was holding them, and that they both had to remain mindful to not let the lack of relative gravity distance them from the Nomaian structure, made the task far more difficult than it had any right to be.</p>
<p>With a panicked sigh, Riebeck looked around them, trying to find at least some way to get a grip on the satellite; and after a few seconds, their eyes lit up. They immediately pointed at a dim and diffused light emanating from the floor on the other side of the broken window.</p>
<p>“Gabbro, I th-think those are gravity panels,” they instructed. “Let’s go there, it’ll be much easier to refill when we’re not in zero-g.”</p>
<p>Gabbro followed their gaze, humming. “Huh. First time I hear of those. Is that floor made of ground up gravity crystals—”</p>
<p>“G-<i>Gabbro</i>.”</p>
<p>“—Right. Coming.”</p>

<hr>
<p>Firn was awoken by the sound and sensation of oxygen rushing into their helmet in a rapid burst, slightly but rapidly increasing the air pressure and making their ears buzz. As they desperately gasped for air, lungs feeling far more empty than they ever thought they would get and so, so happily finding something to fill them again… They decided that this felt like coming back to life.</p>
<p>Their now open eyes went from blurry to focused, and soon locked on to the sight of two astronauts bent over their face in worry — worry which instantly turned to two sighs of intense relief.</p>
<p>“You made it, buddy,” Gabbro complimented with a calm pat on their shoulder. “And you can thank Riebeck for literally saving your life. We both owe them a big one. And, only you this time, you also owe Hal a <i>big</i> apology.”</p>

<wip></wip>

<p>“Now if you don’t mind, after we’re done exploring this part we’re going home. And staying on breathable, non-brittle ground, for a while,” Riebeck stated with a strangely calm voice—albeit calm with some form of hollow light-headedness. “You can take my ship if you want to bring yours back later and—and risk <i>your</i> lives again, <i>without me</i>.” “…No, for real though, please d-don’t risk your lives like this again. I can’t take it.”</p>



<wip></wip>
<p>“Hey, Riebeck,” [Gabbro says while handing them the projection stone] “that thing looks important.”</p>
<p>Riebeck lit up instantly, gasping in excitement. “A projection stone! I– At least I <i>think</i> that’s how the Nomai called them. I’ve always wondered how they worked.”</p>
<p>Firn looked up. “It was floating up there? I didn’t think you’d be able to tell it apart from the debris so fast.”</p>
<p>Gabbro shrugged. “Eh, it wasn’t that hard to find, with it glowing in the dark and all.”</p>
<p>Riebeck eyed them, then the stone, then Gabbro again.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess it stopped glowing when you picked it up.”</p>
<p class=vs>From beneath their visor, Gabbro’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion. That stone plate’s symbol and middle slice were <i>clearly</i> luminescent.</p>
<p>Still, they decided that arguing was not worth the effort.</p>

<wip>Firn observes their surroundings, and at some point it clicks; they recognize that the ruins they are in are the exact ruins they witnessed blowing up as they woke up.</wip>
<p>“This morning, the first thing I saw was a big flash of light right above me, maybe that’s even what woke me up,” they reasoned carefully, deep in thought. “From my perspective at the time, it was just in front of Giant’s Deep. Maybe it was orbiting it.” They raised their eyes to the other two astronauts, sparkling with curiosity and purpose: “I think— that could be it. We could be standing right inside the thing I saw blowing up.”</p>


<wip>[When they both see Riebeck realize that they’re inside Nomai ruins with still usable technology:]</wip>
<p>Firn was startled by the touch of a pat on their back. “Gonna give credit where it’s due, buddy, your idea did lead to a better outcome.” Huh. Hearing Gabbro, or <i>anyone</i> at all in Outer Wilds Ventures say that, felt more good than they had imagined. With a few smaller pats, though: “Still more reckless than geyser jumping. Feldspar would have been proud, and Gossan is gonna lose their mind if they’re ever told about this. And I don’t think you’ll manage to convince Hornfels not to.”</p>
<p>Firn rolled their eyes. “What are they gonna do, ground me?”</p>
<p>Their main answer was a shrug. “Just saying. Don’t give them ideas, especially not before you get to reunite with your ship.”</p>
<p>With a sigh, Firn gave up trying to think of any sass to retort to that. Their eyes soon wandered to Riebeck’s, and when they saw that one of their hands was following the spiral shape of some Nomai scriptures, they decided to come with and join in the fun, translator in hand. Riebeck was delighted beyond reason to realize that they could finally see the new shiny device in action, and even use it themself.</p>
<p>“Can you believe it? They were trying to send some kind of… probe, it seems?” they pondered while in the middle of their reading. “I can only imagine what its destination must have been, or how far it must have gone by now. This cannon seems to have been fired already, but that must have been done <i>ages</i> ago.”</p>
<wip></wip>
<p>“W-wait… I— I’ve <i>seen</i> that thing fire,” they realized with a shocked gasp. “<i>That’s</i> what saw when I woke up this morning!”</p>
<p>Riebeck turned to them all at once, translator in hand. Even with their helmet on, disbelief could be read all over their spacesuit.</p>
<p>“That’s impossible, and you must know it,” they replied simply. “The Nomai are long dead. Who could have possibly sent the order to fire now?”</p>
<p>“But— I know I saw something,” they insisted, bringing a hand to their forehead only to meet their visor in the way. They tried their best to remember what it had looked like… “It was right in front of Giant’s Deep, and it was something small that shot a purple light. I know I saw it.”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t that have been some kind of thunder?” Riebeck offered in a much gentler tone. “I’m not calling you a liar, I do believe you saw something. I just think… I-it’s just impossible for the source of that flash of light to be decrepit abandoned Nomai ruins where nobody in sight could have possibly activated it, could it?” “You say you were waking up, yes? M-maybe, you know… you just weren’t <span class=smol>awake enough t-to really know what it was.</span>”</p>
<p>Firn’s sense of logic tended to agree; at least at first glance, Riebeck was correct: they simply could not think of a way this cannon could simply fire on its own, hundreds of thousands of years after the civilization that had built it had died out. Any Nomai construct they had seen so far could only activate if there was <i>someone</i> nearby to use them, even when the Nomai statues had activated—</p>
<p>The statues.</p>
<p>Gabbro had found these statues weeks ago. They had been able to bring one back to Timber Hearth without it ever doing anything. Even when it had been accidentally chipped and the fallen chunk had been repurposed into their ship’s information storage at the heart of their computer, it had never given any sign of reaction to any of it. And then, one day, it had just… acted out on its own. Done <i>something</i> to Hal, whatever it was. Done something to Gabbro too, on the very same day.</p>
<p>The cannon had been fired first, though. The statues had not activated the cannon—if there truly were any correlation between these two events, and there had to be one, then if anything, the <i>cannon</i> had been the reason why the statues activated; not the other way around.</p>
<p>…This still left the lingering question of <i>what</i> had triggered the cannon, then.</p>

<wip></wip>


<p>Riebeck: “I heard there’s storms on Giant’s Deep, and that it’s not uncommon for the thunder to momentariliy color the clouds in pink or purple. Maybe you just saw a particularly big one?”</p>
<p>“That’s from Giant’s Deep’s surface though, not from the view I had on Timber Hearth.”</p>
<p>Without warning, their debate was interrupted by the sound of Gabbro intruding on their conversation, the static of their radio holding a chilling, uncharacteristic concern.</p>
<p>“Not to butt in, but… You seeing that?”</p>
<p>At first confused, both astronauts stared first at the finger they were pointing in the direction of deep space, then at the gigantic sphere of azure and blinding radiance they were pointing at from the other side of the broken glass window, ever expanding at high speed without any sign of stopping. In unison, they both missed a heartbeat.</p>
<p>“What— w-what <i>is</i> that!?” Riebeck shrieked.</p>
<p>Before anyone could answer, the whiteness reached them, and they were burned alive in an instant.</p>

<p>Firn teared their eyes away from their translator and up to the other side of the windows, frowning. “…Did the sky just get darker all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>Riebeck shrugged, opting to simply point their flashlight in their direction. “This structure is orbiting Giant’s Deep, we must have reached its dark side. I sure can’t see the sun from here.”</p>
<p>Gabbro frowned in turn. “But we already <i>were</i> in the shadow of Giant’s Deep.”</p>
<p>From pitch black, the echoes of the sun soon turned bright blue. Alas, none of the three astronauts were in a position to notice; and back on Timber Hearth, the rotation of the planet on its own axis had decided that, in this moment, sunset had passed and sunrise had yet to come.</p>
