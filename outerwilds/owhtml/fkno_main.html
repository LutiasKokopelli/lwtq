<div class=chp><h1>Worldbuilding notes</h1><ul>
    <li>All durations and distances are <orng><b>multiplied by 10</b></orng> compared to their in-game values (…with, admittedly, some level of leniency and me pretending that the rocket science still makes any sense). In human units, the time loop lasts <orng><b>3h 48min 10s</b></orng>, with the notable detail that the OPC takes around one minute and a half to reorient itself into a different position before it fires, and that similarly people who are paired with statues need some time to process the memories being sent to them before they can be operational again.</li>
    <li>Any location on Timber Hearth sees a sunrise every <orng><b>1h 9min 20s</b></orng>. Additionally, a full rotation of Timber Hearth around the sun (what we would normally call a ‘year’) lasts only <orng><b>41min 43s</b></orng>, which is even shorter. Because of this, Hearthians will not associate the words ‘year’ or ‘day’ and ‘night’ to these natural phenomena, but to more artificial constructs.</li>
    <li>The periodicity of the Hearthian calendar is based not only on the position of the sun in the Hearthian sky, but also of the Attlerock’s. Indeed, a solar eclipse occurs every <orng><b>29min 18s</b></orng> on average, and the time at which the eclipse occurs relative to the village’s sky can be used as a marker of time with some level of periodicity. The longest cycle which can be constructed directly from this is the <b>perfect eclipse sunrise</b> (during which the Attlerock and sun rise in the sky at the same time as an eclipse), which occurs almost every 15 human days (14 days and 21h to be precise).</li>
    <li>Every Hearthian ‘week’ starts with an eclipse sunrise. A week contains 309 day/night cycles (referred to as ‘sunrises’ for convenience), split into 14 Hearthian days with one extra sunrise at the end.</li>
    <li>A Hearthian ‘day’ (our equivalent to a 24h ‘day’) is made of 52 eclipses and <orng><b>22 day/night cycles</b></orng>, of which, on average, 11 are dedicated to sleep and 11 to waking hours. Hatchlings sleep the most, while adults will tend to be active for longer in order to help the community. In human units, such a day lasts 25h 22min 44s.</li>
    <li>The time loop occurs between the 113th and 117th sunrises of the week (written respectively as 113s and 117s), which correspond to the waking sunrise cycles within the sixth day of the week. If I were to roughly translate that into some sort of human calendar by squishing the timing into a 24h clock, the loop would start around “9:45AM” and end at roughly “1PM.”</li>

<div class=chp id=ch000><h1>Prologue</h1><h2>Attempt #459</h2><hr>
<p>The first thing Firn saw upon waking up was a strange flash of light coming from Giant’s Deep.</p>
<p class=vs>The second thing Firn saw as they sat up and yawned quietly was Slate, tending to the campfire and evidently planning to soon roast some marshmallows. They decided to join in, happily reaching out for their stick as the realization of just which day this was drew in.</p>
<p>It was finally their very own launch day! They were excited beyond reason, and impatient to finally board their very own ship… albeit not enough to skip breakfast. Just one last treat or two before blasting off into space would never hurt anyone, and in fact, the delay it gave them was far more merciful to the survival of their entire world than they could have ever imagined.</p>
<p>After spending a few minutes stuffing their mouth with golden delicacies and exchanging with the Hearthian on the other side of the fire some casual banter sprinkled with the occasional sarcastic joke, the third thing Firn saw was Hal jumping off the steep descent all the way down from the observatory and straight in their direction, wearing ample white clothing and holding something that looked like a helmet under their arm. Wait— was that the EVA from the zero-g cave?</p>
<p>Before they knew it, Hal was right by their side and fiercely grabbing their arm, pulling up.</p>
<p>“Morning sleepyhead,” they said absent-mindedly with little to no true meaning or intent behind their words, “sorry for the rough start but we’re a bit strapped for time here.”</p>
<p>“H-<span class=scaps>h</span>al? Wha–Why–How’d you get here!?”</p>
<p class=vs>Firn had so many questions, but only one of them could physically escape their lips in an intelligible manner. Truth be told, they were so confused, and just not quite completely aware enough yet, that they themselves were not really sure which one out of their already humongous and yet continuously growing pile they had managed to phrase in its entirety, or even if a single one of them had been at all.</p>
<p>As they were dragged to the lift platform, they barely had a split second to share a distressed look with a Slate who, mouth gaping wide enough to hypothetically fit at least a dozen uncooked marshmallows simultaneously, was equally too shocked to speak coherently. By the time the next fleeting moment flew by, the shipwright’s face had already disappeared from even their upper eyes’ peripheral vision.</p>
<p>“Hal, what on <i>Hearth</i> is going on!?” they finally asked the moment they found the ability to align words in a proper order, stressing each one of them with a waning confusion which was slowly growing instead into stern annoyance.</p>
<p>“Time loop,” Hal swiftly responded with practiced efficiency, while their fingers pressed in a blur the button sequence separating them from the brand new ship which had all at the same time never launched before, and yet already travelled through the entire solar system. “We’ve been through this before, you just don’t remember it.”</p>
<p>“What? Wait, how’d you know the launch codes—”</p>
<p>“<i>Time loop</i>, Firn.” The elevator stopped with a thud, and Hal immediately resumed their quick pace, completely ignoring Slate’s confused cries resonating from below. “We have barely three sunrises before the sun explodes.”</p>
<p>“Before the sun <i class=scaps>what!?</i>” Instead of an answer, Firn was unceremoniously jostled into their very own ship, losing their balance upon landing on the gravity crystal-powered floor.</p>
<p>“Heard me the first time.” Hal instantly broke their fall with a swift catch under their arms, as if even the way they were about to collapse had been meticulously calculated and practiced countless times, and they gently but firmly guided them to face a specific wall inside their ship.</p>
<p>Firn, having barely recovered their senses enough to question what a ‘time loop’ was even supposed to be and how nonsensical it should be as a concept if one were to dare pull it out of the realm of fiction, nonetheless followed their friend’s finger pointing at something close, and looked down as they saw the Outer Wilds Ventures insignia flicker into something new.</p>
<p>Their jaw dropped.</p>

<!-- @SFOLD — 001 — CHAP. 1:  Launch Day -->
<div id=loop1></div>
<div class=chp id=ch001><h1>Chapter 1</h1><h2>Launch Day</h2><hr>
<p class=vs>It was the third sunrise of the day when Hal was pulled out of their sleep. Letting a grunt fester and die in their throat, their first conscious thought was to make a mental note to themself that they would have to remind Marl to close the blinds before they left the cabin for their daily attempt at sneaking past Rutile and Moraine and try to get a hit or two against <i>that tree</i>.</p>
<p class=vs>Granted, it was an immutable fact that Timber Hearth’s rotation (alongside every type of rotation of every astral body in their solar system, really) was objectively forcing upon them a sunrise every sixty minutes; but it also was an immutable fact that, in spite of the too rapid celestial dance of the star they were orbiting, there surely had to be a <i>reason</i> why their ancestors had evolved to require a minimum of six or seven sunrises of good sleep in a row.</p><p>Some had even theorized that this reason might be related to the fact that this amount of time was the average required in order to maintain the level of intelligence that their species had managed to reach, and Firn had… perhaps, sometimes, unkindly made sarcastic barbs about Marl and waking up early when they too were paying the price of the lumberjack’s disregard for others’ sleeping schedules.</p>
<p>Oh well. They were up now, four eyes bathing in undesired sunlight, and they might as well make some use of these unexpected extra forty minutes or so that the sun had so graciously forced into their hands.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal was almost surprised to not hear Firn complain about the blinds being left open as well, but then they remembered: this night, their cabin had sheltered one less Hearthian than usual.</p>
<p>Today was Firn’s launch day. How could they forget that this was the day their best friend would finally fulfill their lifelong dream?</p>
<p>Hal wondered whether they had a good night. Sleeping under the stars surely wasn’t by a long shot the most comfortable way to have a good rest, for more reasons than one. The founders of Outer Wilds Ventures and Firn themself said that it was a tradition, but they wondered whether it was a good tradition to have their astronauts depart in a state when they were bound to be in less than optimal shape.</p>
<p>They remembered Firn’s first attempt at using a jetpack. They tried not to think about Firn’s ship crashing the same way, but with even more power and momentum. Their attempt was unsuccessful.</p>
<p class=vs>…No, they needed to have more faith in them. Firn <i>had</i> passed the tests, they <i>had</i> convinced Gossan that they were ready, Gossan had even come to tell them in person that Firn was ready and that there was no need to make themself needlessly nauseous with worry about it, and among the founders, Gossan was the biggest stickler for safety.</p>
<p>Firn was going to be <i>fine</i>.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But what if they <i>weren’t?</i></p>
<hr>
<p>About twelve minutes past the sunrise, and Hal was stepping outside, taking in the scent of pine trees and the sight of a village much calmer than they were used to.</p>
<p class=vs>Part of them considered seeing for themself how Firn was doing, but they instantly reconsidered. They knew they would come to bid their goodbyes once they were ready, and from what Hal had been told, Firn would have to traverse the crater and visit Hornfels before their departure. Under these circumstances, making their way to the observatory and waiting for them up there thus sounded like the most convenient plan.</p>
<p>That being said, it wasn’t long before their train of thought had to be interrupted.</p>
<p>“If it isn’t the little Hal!” Gneiss called out with a smile. “Out early today?”</p>
<p>The hatchling rolled their eyes. “Marl forgot to close the blinds. Again. I just thought I’d try getting out of bed, for a change.” A nervous flick of their ears punctuated their frown as they soon added: “Also, I’m not <i>little</i>–”</p>
<p>Gneiss gave a soft, warm laugh. “Well, maybe some day you and Firn will finally adapt to waking up at adult times, and I’ll then start considering you like one. Any elder will tell you that the village needs more hands, and the earlier they are fresh and ready to get the job done, the better.”</p>
<p class=vs>Hal hummed, looking down. Both Firn and they were now considered in age to drink sap wine, even though they had only grown enough to stomach it four weeks ago (and even though, out of the two, either Firn was still struggling with digesting it, or they simply hated the taste). However, with this ritual of adulthood came not just the slow and progressive shedding of a nickname, but also new responsibilities in regards to sustaining the village’s comfort and lifestyle. And as much as they wanted to contribute, Hal was not quite certain how ready for it they were just yet.</p>
<p>They had the Nomai and their many years of hard work poured into deciphering their language, and they would gladly continue doing so their entire life if they could; this was the sort of path that someone like Riebeck had chosen, in a way. But… aside from giving Slate some extremely vague hints about the purpose of this or that rock and then seeing them recycle eons old debris into exploding contraptions, their research simply did not… <i>feel</i> directly useful or special. Not when their village had so many mouths to feed, and not enough hands to gather the food.</p>
<p>And so, albeit reluctantly, Hal wanted to be a part of the village proper. It was not so much about making a difference… More so about simply looking out for each other, and showing their care for the crater as a whole. It was a sense of duty. Gabbro went to space, Riebeck went to space, Firn was about to go to space… <i>Someone</i> needed to stay down here and keep the village alive, even if it meant that they could not afford to spend all of their waking sunrises figuring out more about the Nomai. It wasn’t like they even cared about space, anyway.</p>
<p>“Speaking of, while you’re here,” Gneiss continued, and Hal startled as they wondered whether they might have been dozing off, “I’ve seen you having fun with your whittling lately, and I thought I might ask for your help with a little something.”</p>
<p>Hal blinked, ears perking up. “Oh, of course,” they nodded reflexively.</p>
<p>“Agreeing before I even told you what it was?” the elder chuckled, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>They shrugged, also smiling along. “I mean, if you ask for my help, I guess it’s going to be something I <i>can</i> do, right? And aside from waiting for the next sunrise, well…”</p>
<p>There came another deep and warm chuckle. “You are such a sweet one. Firn should have tried to learn a little bit of that from you.”</p>
<p>“F-<span class=scaps>f</span>irn can be nice,” Hal retorted defensively as they followed the elder inside their cabin and to the workshop. “They’re just… blunt.”</p>
<hr>
<p class=vs>Gneiss had been working on a new fishing rod. As it turned out, Spinel’s last big catch had done quite a number on their favorite one, and despite the fact that they did have spares, it was undeniable that their efficiency had been lacking during the past few days.</p>
<p>Hal had only been enlisted for the finishing, most delicate touches; with the elder sitting by their side and blowing on the last spots of fresh varnish which still remained on the head of their latest unfinished instrument, the sunrise flew by and sunset came without either of them noticing.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal did not mind. This was by no means an activity they would call nearly as enthralling as diving their head in copies and photos of Nomai writings and trying to make any kind of sense from it all, but this was calming; stimulating enough that they would feel engaged in their work, easy and repetitive enough that they could let their mind wander without causing any mistakes. It was… pleasant enough. And the result was going to be useful, so hey, that part felt good.</p>
<p>And, well, anyway, they knew that nothing in their entire life would ever top the sheer excitement and joy that they had experienced during those long, yet far too short months spent on building the translator with their best friend. They already knew that the happiest days of their life were now likely behind them.</p>
<p>They heaved another sigh. <i>Stars</i>, they would miss them.</p>
<p>…Their mind wandered back to reality when they found Gneiss’ hand coming to them and asking for the fishing rod. Apparently, they had judged that they were done adjusting the guide rings…? Hal was not sure they were attached quite well enough, but with a shrug, they hesitantly complied.</p>
<p>“Your help truly is appreciated,” the elder hummed with a soft smile, putting the nearly-but-not-quite finished banjo away. As they did so, they gave a melancholic sigh to a different incomplete craft of theirs, which had been sitting in the same shadowed corner of their workshop for the past few days. “Alas, I was hoping to finish Firn’s instrument before their launch, but I was caught by all those impromptu delays.”</p>
<p>Hal looked down. “Sorry, if I’d known, I would’ve—”</p>
<p>Gneiss exploded in gentle laughter. “Hatchling, I just <i>thanked</i> you for your help! Whatever do you feel the need to <i>apologize</i> for?”</p>
<p>Hal stifled a laugh as well, only letting one short breath come out of their nose as a shy smile took shape in the corner of their lips. “Just a force of habit,” they shrugged.</p>
<p>Gneiss shook their head, looking up at the ceiling with a caring but exasperated sigh. They soon turned their four tired eyes to the hatchling’s work, studying the details of the carving and mounting alike, and smiling with pride while they tested the tool’s durability.</p>
<p>“I know you are far more interested in diving your head in books that were written before our species was even born,” (Hal decided against telling them that, as far as they and everyone else knew, the Nomai didn’t <i>have</i> books per se, just weird magical stones with information somehow directly imprinted into them), “but I’ve seen how delicate you are with your own crafts.”</p>
<p>Hal frowned upon seeing that the elder was no longer looking at them or the fishing rod, and frowned deeper when they followed their gaze and realized what their attention had turned to instead. Their ears gained some light shades of purple as they opened their satchel and took out their latest work in progress… one which, well, they had barely gotten started on the day before, during their last sunrise before sleep.</p>
<p>“What, this? It’s just a stick I picked up and started carving when I was bored.” It did not even look like anything yet, just like a stick with a barely pointed end. It could just as well be used as a bland stake to pitch a tent or grill a fish.</p>
<p>Gneiss stifled a laugh, deciding against pointing out all the other far more elaborate sculptures they had seen in their hands during the past few weeks, and which they were certain were hiding inside this very same satchel in this very moment.</p>
<p>“And the care you put into it would go quite well into helping the village with shiny new tools, if you wanted me to teach you the ropes. My hands aren’t as steady as they used to be, you know, so your talent truly could be put to good use.”</p>
<p>“Heh, thanks… I guess. All of them still need a lot more work, though–”</p>
<p>“Balderdash,” the elder huffed softly, “you worry too much. You’ve got a whole life ahead of you to keep learning.”</p>
<p>“And they’re not particularly useful for the village, they’re just little unfinished trinkets to keep my hands busy—”</p>
<p>“<i>Come now</i>, hatchling,” Gneiss scolded, “you know that isn’t true. You think my instruments are any more useful to the village?”</p>
<p>“At least your instruments bring everyone together during the campfires,” Hal shrugged.</p>
<p>The elder’s gaze deflated in patient and quiet exasperation. “<span class=grey><i>Sigh…</i></span> Whatever are we going to do with you if you keep putting yourself down like that? It’s like if you’re ruining your self-confidence on purpose.”</p>
<p class=vs>Everybody knew Hal could do a lot of great things, with some more polishing that would naturally come with gaining the experience of age. Everybody, except the Hearthian themself.</p>
<p>And for this, Gneiss decided to stop fooling around. “Just show me one of these from up close. If you want criticism this badly, I’ll tell you how much better than you think they truly are. I know you’ve got a couple on hand.”</p>
<p>Ears dropping, Hal took a shy step back. “B-but…”</p>
<p>“Don’t make me pull them out of your bag myself, <i>hatchling</i>,” the instrument maker threatened with a heavy and deliberate emphasis on the infantilizing designation, and Hal cowered a little more with a tiny, barely audible yelp. Those eyes did not look like they were bluffing.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, the young Hearthian opened their satchel again, searching for the least ugly one they could find, and cringing at the sight. Who were they kidding, they were <i>all</i> ugly, the anatomy was all wrong and they could never get the neck right.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, Gneiss did not seem to give a single care in the world for that. “You have quite the wild imagination,” they chuckled softly as they let the wood shine under the sunlight phasing through the pine trees. “I’ve seen you carve quite a lot of these lately.”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah, that was when Gabbro came back with a new finding, a few weeks ago… It was a statue– a <i>complete</i>, intact statue!”</p>
<p>The elder hummed. “A statue made by those… kodai, was it?”</p>
<p>“Nomai,” Hal corrected with a sheepish smile. “I just… all my life, I’ve been trying to imagine what they could <i>look</i> like, and then they made <i>that</i> huge discovery. It just makes me wish even more that I could see a real, live one, but… Well, th-that’s just wishful thinking.”</p>
<p>Seeing their fiddling hands and nervous twitching, Gneiss finally caved in and handed them the little sculpture back. Hal, blushing even more than before, seized it hurriedly and buried it back where it had come from with both haste and, somehow, still delicate care to ensure that it would not be damaged in the process.</p>
<p>“Hornfels told me yesterday that they were almost done prepping it for display,” Hal mumbled. “The– the <i>statue</i>, I mean. Should’ve said that first. Uh, I mean, m-maybe they need help with the final touches, or…” Or maybe they were already done with it by now, it was likely even, but they were not going to mention this out loud when they had finally found a way out.</p>
<p>The elder nodded with a tired chuckle, catching on their attempt at a cop out and choosing to play along. “Well, in that case I won’t hold you back any longer. You can send them my regards.”</p>
<p>With a sheepish and strained nod, the young Hearthian twiddled with the latch of their satchel and turned around mechanically, before trotting away.</p>
<p class=vs>Gneiss sighed. They would come around eventually, they told themself. They had a lot of potential, if only they could be convinced of it and accept that <i>potential</i> did not mean instant perfection. One day, they would realize that experience did not have to be gained instantly and that the only expectations they were currently disappointing were their own.</p>
<p>Hopefully.</p>
<hr>
<p>It was already well past sunset when Hal started climbing up the stairs to the observatory, and they were half cursing the elder for having taken so much of their time giving unwanted attention to their unfinished meaningless works, half berating themself for being rude about it when Gneiss had, all in all, been nothing but nice to them. Mostly.</p>
<p>As they reached the fenced patch of ghost matter and looked to the left, their ears perked up in surprise. If there was one Hearthian they had not expected to see at such high altitude, it would be none other than their older cabinmate.</p>
<p>“Marl?” they called out. “What are you doing up here?”</p>
<p>The swing of an ax was swiftly interrupted, ending craftily hidden behind the lumberjack’s back instead of between two grooves on the trunk. “Oh– Hey, Hal, good morning. Early riser much, today?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, all thanks to you,” they replied with a huff, rolling their eyes. “You forgot the blinds again.”</p>
<p>The taller Hearthian blinked in surprise. Then they brought a hand to their neck, pursing their lips. “Ooh… yeah. My bad.” They paused for a second, then tried to save face: “But you <i>know</i> I have to raise them during the night! Can’t look outside and make sure the road is clear if they’re in the way.”</p>
<p class=vs>Deciding that they would ignore any and all discussions about their increasingly convoluted schemes, Hal squinted, studying the shape of the wood from afar despite the low visibility. They only saw one or two haphazard marks, not nearly deep enough to cause any trouble, perhaps even shallow enough to avoid being noticed. Good.</p>
<p>It was in fact rather intriguing, just how little damage was made. Either Marl had been surprisingly holding back (unlikely), or this specific tree truly was noticeably sturdier than any other (much more likely). Maybe the tree did hold a grudge just as much as Marl did, somehow.</p>
<p>Hal internally snickered at the thought. As if a <i>tree</i> could maintain a feud. “And has it ever occurred to you to just… You know, let it go? Cutting down that tree will cause far more harm than good. You know Rutile means it when they try to tell you that.”</p>
<p>“And Rutile only says that because they can’t stand change. They can’t imagine how good a big tree-less crater would be! Less shade, more sun, a lot more wood. What’s not to love about that?”</p>
<p class=vs>Unfortunately for their ears and sanity, Hal had long given up on trying to bring up the argument that cutting down such a large tree was bound to cause a lot of panic and destruction once its massive trunk would fall upon at least a good half of the village’s cabins.</p>
<p>It did not mean that Marl had failed to notice that the thought had again crossed their mind and simply refused to leave their lips, though.</p>
<p>“I know what you’re thinking,” they mumbled, “and you know what? That’s the <i>point</i>. You do realize that this tree keeps growing, right? Each day that passes, it becomes an even bigger hazard. I’d be doing everyone a <i>favor</i> by getting rid of it as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“Go tell that to Rutile,” Hal sighed while rubbing their lower eyes and glaring with the other pair. “I’m not getting involved in this.”</p>
<p class=vs>“I gave the whole thing some <i>thought</i>, you know,” Marl continued anyway. “You all make a fair point about it being dangerous to try getting rid of the whole tree at once. <i>Buuut</i>, have you considered the alternative? What if I got rid of it <i>little by little</i>, starting from the top.” The ax came out of their back and was sent straight into the tree, accompanied with a grunting <i>oomph</i>; if this newest attempt had left a dent on its surface, Hal failed to find it.</p>
<p>Then, turning once again to their cabinmate as they readied another swing, they concluded with a proud grin: “Sounds much safer now, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>Hal deadpanned. “Marl. Go home before I send Moraine after you.”</p>
<p>The lumberjack pouted, but begrudgingly retracted the ax from the trunk and attached it to their belt before they crossed their arms. Walking away, they grumbled something about <i>thinking that they’d said they wouldn’t get involved</i> and that <i>they were no fun</i>.</p>
<p>“And don’t forget the <i>blinds</i>, next time!” Hal warned with a hand curled up around their mouth to let the sound of their voice reach its target.</p>
<p>As they watched them stomp their way down the mountain road and back to the village below, Hal’s ears caught the sound of laughter coming from behind.</p>
<p>“They’ll never change, will they?”</p>
<p>Hal looked up the path they had intended to take up to the observatory, and found that Gossan was currently walking down from it, having likely witnessed the scene from afar on their way. The flight coach sent them a friendly wave right after their quip, and with a small tired smile, Hal waved back.</p>
<p>“Never mind them,” the hatchling sighed. “You know they’ll be right back at it before the next sunrise.”</p>
<p>There was another amused chuckle as the elder crossed their arms and looked down; but soon, they turned their attention back to the Hearthian next to them, and studied them up and down. “So, today’s the day, huh?” they started as a non-sequitur, yet fully expecting Hal to know exactly what they were talking about. “Not too nervous?”</p>
<p>Hal did not need any reminder as they grew a worried smile. “W-well, I’m not the one going in space,” they shrugged awkwardly. They could not prevent a hand from trying to rub away the tension in their neck, and Gossan’s gaze softened upon noticing.</p>
<p>“Don’t you worry, Hal. I told you countless times, Firn is ready.”</p>
<p>They closed their eyes and heaved a long, pained breath which might as well have been a muffled scream. “<i>I know</i>. But still, I just can’t stop imagining all kinds of things that could happen to them, and they have a tendency to be <i>careless</i>, and…”</p>
<p>Gossan let them trail off in silence, lost in thought. After a short moment, they closed their eyes as well, head lowering ever so slightly. “Just like our first astronaut was,” they said with solemnity and a distinct restraint in the display of their emotions.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal gave these words all they could, in the form of a respectful moment of silence.</p>
<p>It was not a warning; it was not a wish, nor a wish that things could be different. It was simply a statement.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the sky, in the perfect silence brought by the distance and emptiness, an explosion occurred. Neither Hearthian took notice.</p>
<p>“I don’t want Firn to…” Hal caught themselves and bit their lip before they could finish that train of thought. “Sorry. I shouldn’t be saying that.”</p>
<p>The flight coach regained their smile, bittersweet. “You are a great friend, Hal. Firn will miss you as much as you’ll miss them. It’s just that… Well. You know where their eyes have always been.” Their head turned upwards, watching as Giant’s Deep was slowly leaving the zenith.</p>
<p>Hal nodded sadly, following the founder’s gaze. “The stars.”</p>
<p>“Just like Feldspar,” Gossan sighed with the same expression, of both regret and longing. “You just couldn’t keep either of them on this rock for long. Their dreams belong out there, and they’ll never stop chasing them.”</p>
<p>Silence fell again, as for a few moments, the conversation was only being maintained by the hiding crickets. The night sky was pretty.</p>
<p>A deep breath. “I made them promise they wouldn’t be trying any crazy stunts,” Hal mumbled.</p>
<p>Gossan laughed softly. “Then that’s one more reason I trust they won’t, not unless their life depended on it,” they assured– only to notice that the second part of their sentence made the hatchling’s ears flicker in fear. “…By which I mean they are going to be <i>cautious</i> on their first launch, Hal. It’s not as if they were going to try landing on that contraption orbiting the sun. Their first destination is going to be a safe one.”</p>
<p>With yet another sigh, they nodded in silence; convinced, yet not at all reassured.</p>
<p>“Tell you what,” Gossan chuckled again with more enthusiasm, “Tektite told me yesterday that a piece of mining equipment broke in the zero-g cave. I was considering asking Firn to take care of it, as a last-minute refresher. Should convince you that <i>even</i> if they ever get their ship in trouble, they’ll know how to handle it just fine.”</p>
<p>All of the hatchling’s four eyes perked up, as they shifted down to meet Gossan’s face. “You would do that?”</p>
<p>The founder raised their helmet to return their gaze with mischief. “You’re looking at me as if I’d broken that machine on purpose,” they barked in laughter. “It just happens to be a lucky opportunity. I’ll go wait for them here, they better say their goodbyes when they pass by.” And with another knowing look, they specified with fondness: “To the both of us.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Somehow, by some miracle, Hal reached the observatory before the end of the night, having encountered no other obstacle.</p>
<p class=vs>Just from approaching the entrance to the museum, their eyes widened. Hornfels had warned them that they would be done prepping the statue today; but seeing it for themself, no longer within a dusty crate in the backroom, but as a fully fledged exhibit highlighting all its splendor and majesty, made their heart flutter with excitement.</p>
<p>The Nomai statue was towering far above them, and Hal would not have had it any other way. Or, well, perhaps they could have had it <i>just</i> a little lower so it could be easier to study its shapes for their attempts at whittling them into little sticks, but– the thought was still there. This statue radiated the eons of hidden History it possessed, and Hal had nothing but deep reverence for everything it was embodying. Hornfels truly had found the best way to give this masterpiece the respect it deserved.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Hearthian, Hornfels was standing just behind the statue, dusting their hands with a massive grin on their face, admiring from the other side a completed work well done.</p>
<p>They called out happily, and the curator instantly perked up at the sound of their voice. “Hal! Why, good morning! Your timing could not be more fortunate, I’d just asked Gossan earlier to go look for you– This statue is finally ready for display!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I can see that!” the hatchling squealed in turn, completely ignoring the other remark about the flight coach they had run into on their way, too busy counting the stars of wonder which shone out of their eyes. “You did an amazing job, it looks <i>fantastic</i>.”</p>
<p class=vs>Long ago, Firn, and then later Riebeck, had asked them why they were not wishing to apply for the Outer Wilds Ventures training, if they were this fascinated by the Nomai. But Hal did not care about space, they could leave the thrill and motion sickness to those who sought it.</p>
<p>They were excited, yes, but they were also patient; and as such, they were quite content to make do with what those who had opted for exploration would bring back home. Who needed to chase the stars out there in the sky, when they could be brought down here, right into their palms and surrounded by all the tools they needed to study them? If they’d ever feel the urge to go to space, it would only be for the sake of the Nomai, not for space itself. Riebeck surely could relate with that feeling, they simply had found in themself the decisiveness to actually go through with it.</p>
<p>Looking up with a similar expression, Hornfels breathed in satisfaction; then, reluctantly, they detached their eyes from the sight and turned them to the youth by their side. “Ah… It pains me to leave this statue, but I do have a first launch to supervise,” they announced with a teasing wink.</p>
<p>Hal sent them a smile, trying to tame their worry. “Is the weather going to be okay?”</p>
<p>“It has been all day yesterday and up until the first sunrise this morning,” they assured confidently. “I will ensure nothing has changed, but I trust you have seen the sky yourself: not a cloud in sight. The flight conditions could hardly be any more ideal for takeoff.”</p>
<p>Hal gave a nod, confirming that they had seen as much.</p>
<p>“I’ll be upstairs,” the founder announced happily. “You can tell Firn to go find me once they arrive, I will be looking for their launch codes. Have fun admiring the statue in my stead!”</p>
<p>After these last words, Hal burst into honest laughter. They would do that <i>all day</i> if they could.</p>
<hr>
<p>Even the sound of footsteps resonating on the same planks of wood they were standing on failed to pull Hal out of their reverie. Instead, as those footsteps quietened all the while sneaking dangerously closer, what brought them back to reality with the subtlety of a cold bucket of water was the discomfort of someone blowing a small but perfectly aimed puff of air right into their ear.</p>
<p>Jumping almost a full meter above the ground (maybe the Attlerock was passing by and its tidal pull helped a little bit), Hal squeaked while plastering a hand against it and turning towards the source of this assault; then, as soon as they identified the risk, their face melted into laughter. “Firn, how <i>old</i> are you to still make these jokes?”</p>
<p>Ignoring their question, the newcomer crossed their arms with mock jealousy. “I see you’ve found a new best friend to replace me while I’m gone,” they teased with a toothy grin.</p>
<p>From anyone else, such remark would have been met with flushed cheeks and fumbling apologies. From Firn, though, Hal had long learned to reply with a roll of their lower eyes and a half-amused, half-annoyed snicker.</p>
<p>“It <i>is</i> beautiful, though, don’t you think?” they sighed dreamily as they once again turned to it. “Can you realize that we can finally have an idea what the Nomai used to look like? And– I’m still not over it even if I’ve seen it weeks ago, but do you see all that fur? <i>Silkmoths</i> have fur! That’s so weird!”</p>
<p>“You think they had a larval stage too?” Firn laughed, finding the sight quite hard to imagine, yet willing to indulge in it just for the sake of being able to call the mental image funny.</p>
<p>“We have yet to see any of their writings describe anything of the sort,” Hal shrugged. “But who knows, maybe you will once you’re out there.” Marking a pause, they blinked in sudden recollection and studied their friend up and down, evidently searching for an item in particular. “Speaking of, where’s the translator? Did you have someone prep it inside your ship already?”</p>
<p>With a smirk, Firn reached into their back, pulled out of their belt the tool in question, and made its tiny, thin and light shape whirl between their fingers for a full rotation or two before they grabbed its handle and held it firmly.</p>
<p>This latest stunt wrested an anxious hiss and two pairs of bulging eyes out of Hal, who just barely calmed down upon seeing a second later that everything was in control. They still bit their lip and frowned. “I-it’s <i>fragile</i>, Firn! <i>Please</i> don’t handle it like that. Geez– If you <i>break</i> it, I swear I’ll…”</p>
<p>For the first time this morning, the cadet’s smug expression softened ever so slightly. “Hey, relax, I’m gonna protect it with my <i>life</i>,” they said instantly with determination, and Hal knew they were being sincere. It was almost a shame that the smug grin instantly came back: “I mean, you’re not the only one who’s spent months of your life perfecting it, you know. I don’t want to see all that hard work go to waste either.”</p>
<p>They were met with a deadpan look. Firn be thrown into the depths of Dark Bramble if they so much as let any genuine kindness whatsoever be seen by others for more than <i>five seconds</i>. It was no wonder most people were so easily fed up with them.</p>
<p>“You’re insufferable.”</p>
<p>“And owning it with pride.”</p>
<p>They really would never change, would they? It somehow was this constant blend of masquerades and incongruous sincerity that Hal could never understand, and yet found so fascinating. Firn knew that they were one of the few who could see through their jokes, and… In a way, that made Hal feel special in their eyes. Firn had never called anyone else their best friend, and Hal could hardly imagine the prospect that they ever would.</p>
<p>Hal sighed, eyes going back and forth between their friend and the statue. “So, any plans while you’re out there?”</p>
<p>Firn pouted, looking at the ceiling and shrugging with a disinterested tilt of their head. “Ehh, I think I’ll start small with the Attlerock. I’m still not sure how safe those retro-rockets are,” and their expression had already turned into closed smug eyes and a cocky smile. Opening their upper eyes again, then their lower ones, they dared shed their brashness, and instead let their genuine excitement shine as they whispered and exclaimed at the same time: “Besides, I bet you’re <i>dying</i> to know what kind of device the Nomai were calibrating there! I know <i>I</i> am.”</p>
<p class=vs>Hal’s eyes lit up just as much at the sound of these words. Years ago, Feldspar had brought back from their first successful expedition a wall with the very first Nomai writings to be found in outer space; the very same wall that had given both them and Firn a wave of wonder and awe, and the determination to one day decipher its secrets.</p>
<p>The idea that on this very day, Outer Wilds Ventures would finally get to find out what these Cassava and Filix were talking about… Oh, they were so excited that it made them feel nauseous.</p>
<p>“Anyway,” Firn concluded with their usual detached and smug tone, “it’s not that I don’t like your company, but I’ve got some launch codes to fetch. Can’t figure out the secrets of the Nomai if I don’t get off this rock first.”</p>
<p>With a sad blink, Hal’s smile turned bittersweet. “Right. Almost forgot you had to go.”</p>
<p>Tentatively, with pleading eyes, they dared raise their hands and ask for one last hug. Firn pursed their lips, looking around their surroundings nervously, before stepping forward and accepting it.</p>
<p>For what had to be the sixth time or so, Hal rolled their eyes. “<i>Relax</i>, burnt mallow, nobody’s watching. Your reputation isn’t gonna crumble just by letting <i>some</i> caramel ooze out instead of carcinogens when you bid your heartfelt goodbyes.”</p>
<p>“Tsh. And you say <i>I’m</i> insufferable,” the cadet snickered; but their embrace tightened, and for but a short second, there was one small insistent shake of their arms as they squeezed tighter still.</p>
<p>Both childhood friends remained like this in silence, taking in their last moments together; but alas, this magical moment could not last forever.</p>
<p>Pulling out of their embrace and sharing one last fond glance with all four eyes, Firn’s smile softened. “Hey. If you ever miss me, you know you can just go ask Hornfels to radio me, I’m sure they won’t mind. I promise I’ll pick up. I’ll try to keep you updated on what I find on the Attlerock ruins, too, in real time! …Assuming I’m not too busy jumping around and having fun with the low gravity.”</p>
<p>Closing their eyes and shaking their head, Hal crossed their arms and smiled. “Yep. Insufferable.” With one last look, they sighed deeply, before concluding with a twinge of regret they tried their best to stifle: “Go on, don’t let me hold you back. Just make sure to take care of yourself, you hear?”</p>
<p class=vs>As sole answer, they received a single, tiny but sincere nod. With one last shared wave, Hal watched as their best friend walked out of the room and up the stairs to the observatory. They took a few steps forward, only stopping at the edge of the door leading to the rest of the museum’s exhibits, and their eyes followed from a distance until the ceiling hid them from view. And then… only then did the realization truly hit.</p>
<p>In this instant, for the first time in their life, Hal felt loneliness; and with it, there came a pang in their stomach as a feeling of inexplicable dread grew in their heart: the feeling that it would be a long, long time, until they would ever truly see them again.</p>
<p>Far was it from their mind to know just how true both of these statements were going to become.</p>
<hr>
<p class=vs>Thinking that Firn would have to step down those very same stairs anyway in order to walk out of the museum and reach the launch tower, Hal had decided to stay right where they were, and to go back to admiring the statue.</p>
<p>No matter how many times they looked, they could never get tired of the sight; every new second of observation seemed to reveal yet another detail they had missed before.</p>
<p class=vs>With a hand to their satchel, they plunged their fingers inside and felt the carved wood of their previous ongoing attempts at trying to recreate it. They couldn’t help it, perhaps they were indeed obsessed with this statue, almost as much as Hornfels was.</p>
<p>Looking down, they pulled out the stick they had picked up on the evening before. If they were going to wait for their friend’s return, they might as well busy their hands with something in the meantime.</p>
<p class=vs>Their knife started digging into the wood, but then they stopped and frowned.</p>
<p>Right. It simply wouldn’t do to proceed with the whittling here, they’d be getting sawdust all over the place. It hadn’t been much of an issue before in the workshop since it already was a mess anyway, but this was a <i>museum</i>, and Dark Bramble take them if they would be even the <i>last</i> Hearthian to dare soil this room.</p>
<p>Raising one last glance at the statue, they tried to memorize its shape as best they could, then lowered their gaze towards the exit and went on their way; not suspecting a single second that a long-awaited discovery from the furthest reaches of their solar system was about to be made, and that in less than a minute, its image would be indelibly carved not on wood, but directly into their own mind.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal was just passing by the exhibit when their ears caught the clang at the start of a mechanical whirr– or rather, of the gritting and inexplicable sound of stone scraping against stone.</p>
<p>Jumping in surprise, they tilted their head around and looked over their shoulder, then spun their entire body and opened their mouth, ready to scream—</p>
<p>The statue opened its eyes.</p>

<!-- @SFOLD — 001 — CHAP. 2:  9,318,054 -->
<div class=chp id=ch002><h1>Chapter 2</h1><h2>9,318,054</h2><hr>
<p>As much as all the intricacies of the Nomai’s greatest technological achievement had attempted to take such basic parameters into account, the process of pairing with a statue had never been expected to be a particularly enjoyable experience.</p>
<p class=vs>In this regard, never had Phlox or Daz ever intended to imply or pretend the opposite — provided, alas, they could ever be given the chance to be inquired about it.</p>
<p>Had the circumstances been any different, both would have graciously shared the forewarning with any Nomai, or even any other lifeform who might end up involved in their project, willingly or otherwise; and naturally, they would have put in all the necessary hard work to ensure that the latter case would be a risk fully secured into the realm of impossibility.</p>
<p>After all, it simply was a well-known fact, or at the very least a quite intuitively conceivable one, that nature had never felt the need to prepare any species in the entire universe for the eventuality that a living, conscious observer’s brain, would one day be asked to share with an alien contraption the surprisingly immense amount of information and cerebral stimuli that could be amassed and recorded during the past thirty-two minutes of a regular Hearthian’s casual morning, and to then process it all over again in reverse within the span of no more than three seconds and seventy-eight hundredths.</p>
<p>Adding to this the additional margins of error brought upon by the subtle differences in biology which could only be expected of two species with vastly diverging anatomies and metabolisms who originated from two respectively foreign star systems, as well as the entire multi-planet-scale device’s old age in spite of its remarkably close to intact state of preservation… It was not particularly difficult to come to a very simple conclusion:</p>
<p>Hal’s next three seconds and seventy-eight hundredths following the exact moment of the statue’s eyes opening were far from pleasant.</p>
<p>Linguist as they were, Hal found themself unable to find words to describe whatever had just transpired in the confines of their mind; though, admittedly, this predicament may have been related to the fact that for the few instants that followed, they found themself already busy attempting to remember how to comprehend an abstract and artificial concept as profoundly complex and unintuitive as recognizing up from down.</p>
<p>The next moment, they heard loud steps running in their direction. Every ounce of intelligence and awareness they had been gifted at birth and proceeded to actively nurture ever since came back in a flash — including the now inherent knowledge that, a few seconds ago, those footsteps had been running <i>down</i>wards, and had therefore at some prior point originated from <i>up</i>wards. Upstairs, even.</p>
<p>“Hal, are you alright!?”</p>
<p>Hal forced all four eyelids closed, then open, then closed and open again, <i>hard</i>. Their light-headed neck rotated towards the source of this panicked sound, not unlike how the statue had done just a moment before.</p>
<p>It was Firn. Judging from their bewildered expression, they must have finished walking down the stairs just in time to witness the same strangeness that they just had. Which meant…</p>
<p>“Did… did you <i>see</i> that?” they asked weakly, pointing with a quivering arm at the three golden orbs which an instant prior were shining bright and <i>sucking in their mind somehow</i>, but had now gone extinguished.</p>
<p>“Almost missed it, but yeah! That statue just moved on its own!” Rushing to it without a single thought, Firn placed a hand on the empty eyeballs, poking the central one tentatively. “Weren’t its eyes <i>closed</i> before!? Did you know it could open them?”</p>
<p class=vs>With their best friend’s swift curiosity and enthusiasm, Hal could feel a small headache fill their brain. Describing their mind as <i>cloudy</i> would be a mistake, as in fact, they could feel their thoughts as far more lucid and almost <i>tangible</i> as they had ever been before, but… Well.</p>
<p>It would be more akin to the sensation that <i>something</i> had dug straight into their head, like a young misbehaved hatchling sneaking into Hornfels’ records and stealing one specific cassette whose contents would be related to the past half sunrise or so — then unwound their thoughts memory by memory the same way this same hatchling would enjoy themself seizing the end of the tape and pulling it all out of its casing, little by little, in reverse, with ignorant yet cruel glee — and finally, once finished, left the whole thing for the recorder’s owner to sort out the mess and carefully coil the tape back into the neat black cylindrical reel it was supposed to be left as.</p>
<p>Just as they thought that Firn would remain completely oblivious to their state of mind and be enthralled by the Nomai statue just as deeply as they themself once had, another pained and slow blink conveniently hid the moment during which the young cadet turned around, their curious and excited smile having turned upside down. “…Wait, no, sorry. Hal, are you okay? You look <i>awful</i>.”</p>
<p class=vs>Hal blinked again, the gesture becoming progressively less strained. The tape of their memories was being recoiled carefully, and with the past half sunrise now put back in order, then came the turn of reviewing the moments that followed.</p>
<p>Again came this distressing feeling — this feeling that they could almost observe their own memories with excruciating detail, as if they were back in the past living through them a second time, all the while feeling like a distant observer trapped within their own body, incapable of interfering with events that had already been set in time. That they could not shake the precognition that it felt as if something <i>else</i> was taking the role of an observer at the same time as they did— Both truths left them struggling to focus proper, and struggling even harder not to let their body tremble in panic, or their nauseated and stressed out stomach churn and turn upside down, their breakfast along with it.</p>
<p>Nonetheless. They put the recent memory under close, analytical scrutiny, feeling somehow assisted in the process by some force which insisted on making them keep a greedy grip on those moments, on never allowing themself to let them slip away from their mind, on having them dissect every detail of it, for fear that something could possibly erase them soon.</p>
<p class=vs>Firn had described the statue’s movements.</p>
<p>Nothing about the eyes glowing, or the… the <i>glowing</i> in general, or the everything else.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, there was only one explanation as to why anyone with an iota of common sense, but especially someone like <i>Firn</i>, would express surprise for the former, but not even bother acknowledging the latter’s existence. And so, this reasoning led to one disappointing conclusion:</p>
<p>“You… so you didn’t see it,” Hal mumbled weakly with a twinge of sadness.</p>
<p>To be fair, they themself were not certain that they had quite <i>seen</i> any of these floating purple strings, or the eyes’ purple light swallowing them all, either. Not with… not really with their own four eyes, that was.</p>
<p>Still, linguistics be thrown to the bramble for just five minutes, because they truly needed at least <i>some</i> amount of leniency, ‘seeing’ would have to do. “I… I think I… saw my own memories replay before me? <i>Backwards?</i>” Yeah. That sounded good enough.</p>
<p>Firn’s eyebrows were raised at first; but soon, their gaze softened instead, as a gentle but teasing smirk appeared in the corner of their lips. “Aah, I see. Saw your life flashing before your eyes, huh?” They laughed with their usual sarcasm, though they still gave a genuine attempt at not sounding condescending. “I mean, <i>yeah</i>, I bet seeing that huge thing move on its own just to stare you down would scare the living daylights out of anyone. <span class=smol>…Especially you. No offense.</span>”</p>
<p>That was… a <i>decent enough</i> explanation, perhaps? They replied with a strained chuckle. “Heh… You’d think it was just that. That’d… make sense, I guess.” Turning their eyes to their friend, they tried to replicate their relaxed laugh. It came quite a little bit broken. “Still, I can’t help but feel like… there was more to it?”</p>
<p class=vs>Taking a deep but tense breath right in the next second, Hal tried to appreciate the fact that the tape had finally been put back in order, with the headache slowly starting to fade in turn, and that with it they were <i>finally</i> left with no event to live through except for the present.</p>
<p>Now that their thoughts could fully focus, though… The more seconds slipped by, the more distant and outlandish their previous sensations became, fading into none but the blur of a dream in the back of their mind. And as a consequence, with those same seconds slipping by… the more they questioned the possibility that all of this had been nothing but a <i>particularly potent</i> nauseating hallucination caused by their own tendency to scare themself to death at even the tiniest little things.</p>
<p>Feeling the pressure of Firn’s skeptical eyes boring four holes of extreme doubt directly into their skull, what little confidence they had in that ridiculous theory instantly crumbled to dust.</p>
<p>“…Ugh, what am I saying,” they sighed tiredly, bringing a hand to their forehead and rubbing away the last trails of tension on their face. “Did the Nomai even have mind-reading technology? Is it even possible?” With another sigh, their other hand went to follow the first so they could rub both pairs of eyes at once. “Forget I said anything. Maybe I just need to lay down for a bit.”</p>
<p>The last remaining traces of Firn’s smug smirk faltered completely, letting their ears drop with the smallest signs of guilt. Crossing their arms and regaining a determined expression, they turned their eyes again to the latest museum exhibit and huffed with disgruntlement, mind scrambling for any trail which could lead to even the <i>beginning</i> of an explanation.</p>
<p>In the end, they decided to drop any jokes and jump down into the realm of the steady and rough solid grounds normally called <i>evidence</i>. “Well, whatever happened, what’s for sure is that this statue did <i>some</i>thing. It’s been on this planet for <i>weeks</i> and you’ve been standing here <i>all morning</i> for all I know, so why’d it only act up <i>now?</i> You didn’t touch it somewhere new or anything, did you?”</p>
<p>Hal shook their head. “Absolutely not, I was even on my way to <i>leave</i>.”</p>
<p>Firn’s lips opened instinctively, ready to offer the sarcastic hypothesis that perhaps the statue was just feeling lonely and did not want its greatest admirator to abandon it; but just as quickly, they found the physical restraint to close their mouth before it came out.</p>
<p>Tapping an index finger against their elbow with increasingly faster velocity and stronger impact, they pursed their lips and grunted with the frustration of facing a roadblock. A short moment later, they looked Hal up and down one more time, assessing their state, before turning again to the statue. “Where’d you say it came from again?”</p>
<p>Hal’s hands finally managed to stop trembling, they just noticed after looking down. Raising their head back to their best friend, they frowned, then replied with decisiveness: “Giant’s Deep. It was Gabbro who found it.”</p>
<p>Firn nodded. Their back was still turned to them, but they rotated their head just enough for Hal to see that they were sending them a mischievous grin. Mischievous not out of ill intent at the prospect of them preparing another nefarious plan, or at least they did not believe so… But rather, this mischief appeared to have found its spark in the hope of finally having a thread to start with.</p>
<p>“Forget the Attlerock. I know which planet I’m crashing my ship into.”</p>
<p>Hal’s ears twitched nervously, face crumpling in worry. “D-do you <i>have</i> to say ‘crash’?” they cringed, trying all over again to dismiss the mental image. “Also, that’s not… You think Hornfels would agree to let you go there on your first trip? From what Gabbro said, it sounds pretty dangerous, with the current, and the storms, not to mention the—”</p>
<p>Firn rolled their eyes in annoyance. “I’ll <i>make</i> them agree. It’s important to you, and it’s related to the statue they’ve been obsessing over. With reasons as big as that, I’m sure they’ll allow a last-minute change of plans.”</p>
<p>They tried to argue, but by the time their mouth opened, their friend had already grabbed their wrist, looking at them with four eyes filled with determination.</p>
<p>“Come on,” they said with a much softer tone and an encouraging smile. “You’ll even get to scold me over the radio if you feel like it. Sure Hornfels would like for that to happen.”</p>
<p>With an anxious sigh, Hal reluctantly let their friend guide them to the observatory. Before they turned around and aimed for the stairs, they gave one last glance at the statue — this time, not with awe, but with disdain and apprehension.</p>
<p>Even now that they had broken eye contact with it… Somehow, they still felt observed.</p>
<hr>
<p>The moment Hornfels heard that the statue’s eyes had opened, their ears closed to any other potential detail to that story, and their role as ground control had been all but forgotten. With only one idea in mind, the one who had now put on their museum curator’s hat instead wanted nothing to do with the observatory, and everything to do with the statue room.</p>
<p>Which was precisely why Firn did everything in their power to stop them from leaving their post.</p>
<p>“Firn, how can you share such news and not even let me <i>study</i> it!? I’ve spent night after night for <i>weeks</i> trying to get those eyes to open, and now that they have, you won’t let me go down and find out why they did? Just go to the Attlerock like we all agreed, surely you don’t need me for that!”</p>
<p>“And that’s what I’m trying to tell you, Hornfels, that’s <i>exactly</i> why I’m going to <i>Giant’s Deep!</i>”</p>
<p>“You can’t just change your flight plans at the last second, let alone on your first launch! Why would you even want to go this far off-planet when I already have all the tools I could ever need inside the workshop?”</p>
<p>Firn rolled their eyes. “And I say it’ll be much more useful to investigate directly the place where it came from! What are you going to do, stay in the museum, point your signalscope at it, and look for brain waves all day?”</p>
<p>The curator frowned, leaving their desk and making their way towards the stairs. “I’m not sure why you would mention <i>brain waves</i> specifically, but I will have you know that using an encephalogram under these circumstances would be a far more relevant approach—”</p>
<p>The astronaut crossed their arms and frowned deeply, deliberately blocking the path. “Hornfels, I’m getting off this rock <i>today</i>, and I’m gonna figure this whole thing out right from where that statue came from. I have the translator and a radio, I can report everything I find in real time!”</p>
<p>“Firn, as much as I value your interest in solving this statue’s mystery, you really shouldn’t change your flight schedule at such short notice,” the founder tried to reason with cautious concern. “This is your first launch, you need to understand that Giant’s Deep might remain a little more than you can chew for now. You will have all the time to investigate there on later expeditions, and perhaps find more statues to study—”</p>
<p>Firn’s fists clenched. Barely controlled boiling blood coiled into a thick ball inside their throat. “It’s not about the <i>statue</i>, Hornfels!” they finally exploded. “It did <i>something</i> to Hal, and I’m going to <i>find out</i> what it was, you hear me?”</p>
<p>Hal gasped, looking wide-eyed at their friend. They were not sure what to think– was Firn actually trusting them now? But also, were they even planning on convincing Hornfels as well, now?</p>
<p>Speaking of Hornfels, their eyebrows fell at once, gaze now jumping from one hatchling to the other back and forth, as they startled as well — albeit, for a different reason. “What exactly do you mean by ‘did something’?”</p>
<p>“I said I was <i>going</i> to find out,” Firn repeated angrily.</p>
<p>The curator turned to their friend with confusion and concern. “Hal, what are they talking about? The statue turned to you and opened its eyes, that much I understand, but– there was <i>more</i> to it?”</p>
<p>Hal took a step back, unsure how to describe their experience and make it sound anything other than utterly mad and nonsensical. “It’s… it’s complicated, I didn’t even think Firn would– believe me.”</p>
<p>Firn crossed their arms. “Which is why I’m saying I’m not sure what happened,” they stated coldly.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal’s ears dropped at the same time as their eyes turning to the ground. That made more sense; of course they wouldn’t believe something so outlandish.</p>
<p class=vs>They were, however, quite surprised to feel Firn grabbing their wrist and squeezing lightly, as if to try and somewhat comfort them. When they looked up at their face, they found the expression that had truly earned Firn’s place in the Outer Wilds Ventures program:</p>
<p>The expression of a dedicated, analytical and thorough investigator.</p>
<p>“<i>Something</i> happened alright, <i>I was right there</i>,” Firn continued. “But Hal says there was more to it, something only they saw— something to do with their mind, or memories, right?” The cadet gave a quick look in their direction; Hal gave them a tiny nod, and they nodded in return with a hum. “Point is, it’s hard for now to tell how much of it was just Hal trying to recover from the fright, and how much of it was the statue <i>really</i> doing something. But I’m willing to believe that if a however-old-that-thing-is statue just moved on its own to specifically turn towards them— I hardly think the Nomai would create that kind of thing just for the sake of scaring people out of their skins. It <i>had</i> to have another purpose.”</p>
<p>It had been a whole minute or two since Hornfels had fallen silent, listening to their reasoning; their face made it hard to tell whether it was because they were actively listening and agreeing with this train of logic, or if they had simply given up on trying to stop them.</p>
<p>Firn let go of their arm so they could go back to crossing their own, and with one last head tilt upwards, they brought their demonstration to its conclusion: “And now I’m getting to my real point: <i>even</i> if whatever happened was all in Hal’s head and the statue did nothing else, I still believe the statue was <i>meant</i> to do something else; and if it didn’t do it, it means either that it’s broken, or that Gabbro took it away from the rest of the mechanism it was supposed to be a part of, which also means that it’s technically broken. In both cases: we have <i>zero chances</i> to figure out what the statue was meant to do by staring at it downstairs, and our only way to find any answers is to explore Giant’s Deep.”</p>
<p>And with that last word being uttered, the young cadet fell silent and stared defiantly, wordlessly daring Hornfels to so much as try to think of a counterargument.</p>
<p>Hal was impressed, that was for sure. Impressed by what, however, was far less certain. Were they more impressed by the apparent flawlessness and fluidity of their reasoning, or by the fact that at the end of the day, the sole objective behind said reasoning had been nothing but the self-centered motivation of making it impossible to stop them from doing what they wanted?</p>
<p>Hornfels stared for what had to be almost an entire minute. Then, they brought an exasperated hand to their lowered face and started rubbing the bridge of their nose. With a heavy and loud defeated sigh, they conceded: “<i>Fine</i>, have it your way! But I am <i>not</i> letting you do this alone. Go meet up with Gabbro first, you are going to need someone who has the field experience.”</p>
<p>Firn’s smirk turned insufferably triumphant. It was not a complete victory, but it was good enough, and just about the best outcome they could have hoped for. “Deal.”</p>
<p>And without any other word, the newest astronaut turned around and practically ran down the stairs, barely sending Hal one last wave with a distracted hand.</p>
<p>Hal so dearly hoped that Gabbro would manage to keep them safe.</p><p>Somehow.</p>
<hr>
<p>Taking off had been easy. Firn remembered their training, they had located and memorized all the buttons on their dashboard days ago, and they had no reason to stay a single second longer than necessary on the soil of Timber Hearth.</p>
<p>Locating Giant’s Deep while out of the atmosphere had been a little more difficult. Firn remembered that it was high up in the zenith when they woke up, but that was just about a whole hour earlier; and in this span of time, the planet had been granted enough time to get to the other side of the Hearthian sky.</p>
<p>Locating Gabbro became even harder when Firn realized that they probably should have remembered to turn on their ship’s signalscope <i>before</i> entering its atmosphere and having to suddenly keep all four eyes not on trying to find the signal of a barely audible flute (were they even playing at all? They could not pick up any signal on planet), but instead on the dozen of cyclones raging all around them.</p>
<p>Firn did not want to admit to Hornfels that <i>maybe</i> their training had not quite yet taught them how to time last-second dodges between moving walls of wind and water.</p>
<p>And <i>Gabbro</i>— What were they <i>doing?</i> They couldn’t pick up their signal anywhere!</p>
<p class=vs>Another cyclone had to be dodged— and as they were forced to turn around in a full half circle in order to evade <i>yet another</i>, they sputtered in shock as they saw an entire <i>island</i> fall from the sky, and right back into the ocean.</p>
<p>Wait… A black trail seemed to be coming out of it. Was that smoke? A campfire!</p>
<p>Their signalscope finally decided to pick up a sound coming from the Outer Wilds Ventures frequency. Gabbro’s flute was always the hardest to listen to due to its low volume and pitch, and the surrounding roaring winds certainly did not make it any easier now… But if on top of this the island had not even <i>been</i> on the surface of the planet until just a few seconds ago, then <i>of course</i> trying to locate it was a plan bound for failure.</p>
<p>Still, that was not all. Firn instantly noticed that this time… Gabbro’s playing sounded a lot more strained and tired than usual. To be fair, if Firn themself had been the one being thrown up into orbit and then back down like this, they likely would not be playing at all.</p>
<p>Well, whatever was happening, it was no use trying to play guessing games when they could simply find out upon landing.</p>

Gabbro actually gets paired with the statue <i>after</i> Hal did, not at the same time. When Firn arrives, they are still recovering, and the sound of the cyclones is not helping.
By this point, Gabbro’s Island has actually been taken by a cyclone and pulled away from Statue Island, meaning that Gabbro couldn’t go back there without Firn’s ship.

Firn lands on Gabbro’s Island and opens their signalscope to follow the signal of Gabbro’s flute, finding that they are nearby.
-->
<p class=vs>Firn frowned at the ground, attempting a jump only to barely manage not to collapse under their own doubled weight, and to barely fail at repressing the instinct to flail their arms around to maintain their balance upon landing.</p>
<p>So much for looking forward to the Attlerock’s low gravity and the fun prospect of magically losing two thirds of their usual weight.</p>

<wip></wip>

<p>Firn tensed up. “You mean a statue?”</p>
<p>The older astronaut snapped their fingers and pointed at them in short-lived gratitude. “A <i>statue</i>, yes. Got uh, some words mixed up right after it happened, heh. That sure was <i>something</i>, felt like getting my whole brain turned upside down for a bit. After that I figured it’d been more than enough emotions for the day and that I’d frankly deserved some rest to, uh. Get my thoughts together before trying to go back to work and take a better look.”</p>
<p>Firn squinted. "So you came back to lie in your hammock."</p>
<p>Gabbro turned their helmet to them, eyeing them with an unreadable look. "Got a problem with that?"</p>
<p>"You don’t want to figure out what that was all about?"</p>
<p>Gabbro somehow managed to dig themself deeper inside the hammock. "As I said: *later*." A pause. They raised their flute. "Probably." They sighed. "Not gonna lie, I’d gladly remove my helmet and get some good massaging done about that headache, but I don’t wanna take the risk of that fury over there coming for a visit and giving us a ride straight for the sky." They started playing again.</p>
<p>Firn’s hands clenched into fists. "That happened to Hal too."</p>
<p>The music stopped again.</p>
<p>"…Ah." "They, uh, doing alright?"</p>
<p>"They’re holding up. They should be with Hornfels, I’d planned to radio them soon after landing."</p>
<p>Gabbro nodded. "Good. Good. I was afraid they’d throw up after this. Sure is a trip, and not the fun kind."</p>
<p>Firn let an audible grunt resonate and die in their throat. Gabbro turned their head again.</p>
<p>"Hm. So that’s why you’re here instead of anywhere else, huh. It went after Hal, so now it got <i>personal</i>."</p>
<p>"And you should be taking it personally too," Firn scolded. "Hal’s gotten better after just a few minutes. Gonna put my mallows on you exaggerating it as an excuse to take the day off."</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>"It really was that bad, buddy."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I’ve seen Hal, I’ll believe you on that. Just saying— emphasis on *was*."</p>
<p>Gabbro mumbled something about Hal being logical and good at sorting their own ideas, and about their own brain already being messy from the start even before their statue friend threw a cyclone out of its eyes and into theirs and threw basically all of their memories straight into orbit, and that *stars above* it was not fun to try maintaining a conversation when it felt like all their memories were still somewhat scrambled and vivid in their mind, and that they would be *extremely* thankful if they could leave and let them meditate as an attempt to chase all that away. Firn raised an eyebrow at all that, but decided not to take any of it at face value, given the amount of evident metaphors and the lack of any solid, tangible evidence in their words.</p>
<p>"Welp," the cadet sighed, "I’m radioing Hornfels. Thanks for the warm welcome," they added with an annoyed roll of their upper eyes.</p>


<wip></wip>


<p>“Gabbro said something similar happened to them.” Then, turning to Gabbro: “How’d you phrase it again?”</p>
<p>“Spiritual experience with a rock shaped like a face,” they tiredly recited without hesitation. Blinking, they perked up in surprise: “…Huh. I actually remembered the exact wording.”</p>
<p>“You said it, like, two minutes ago,” Firn deadpanned.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, with how <i>backwards</i> my entire brain is right now, forgive me for being happy to find something even remotely coherent in it.”</p>

<wip></wip>

<p>Hornfels: “Gabbro, did you get <i>alien algae fumes</i> in your oxygen tank?”</p>
<p>“What? No!” “…Not <i>this</i> time, at least.” Geysers, they did not dare imagine how much <i>horribly worse</i> that would have made this whole thing, given the fact that this was an already far too upsetting experience.</p>
<p>Then again… It was a reasonable hypothesis to ponder whether their struggling so much to recover the same way Hal had <i>may</i> have been related to their undying habit to continuously put their body’s resistance to common natural compounds to the test (for science). This was painfully similar to the time they had tried opening a jellyfish’s head and accidentally inhaled the viscous, strangely volatile (and probably toxic) liquid that had oozed from it. But also not, given how this newest experience was rather forcing them into <i>lucidity</i> instead of allowing them to embrace the hypnotic transe instigated by the twirling cyclones. Was it weird to say that they did not enjoy that lucidity? Probably, unless they could specify that there <i>was</i> such a thing as too much lucidity. Having your own brain try to make you process and relive your latest memories in the back of your mind at the same time as you were trying to hold a normal conversation <i>definitely</i> counted as too much lucidity.</p>

<!-- Hal and Gabbro talk about their experiences in order to compare notes and confirm that they both lived through the same thing. -->
<wip></wip>


<p>"Gabbro, this is Firn’s <i>first launch</i>, and they chose as their first destination a planet filled with thunder, a raging ocean with drifting islands which render any attempts at mapping it futile, and <i>cyclones</i>. Having an experienced astronaut to keep an eye on them will prove extremely valuable, all the more when you are <i>already standing</i> in the place they intend to investigate."</p>
<p>Gabbro finally put the flute down. "Fine. You're the boss, Horns." With a sigh, they sat up and unceremoniously threw their legs over the hammock, jumping down and letting their knees bounce down and back up as they landed, evidently well-practiced in the arts of dealing with the increased gravity and knowing how to efficiently cushion the strain on their legs.</p>
<p>Firn grunted under their breath. They were hoping that ground control would rather put an emphasis on the <i>second part</i> of that argument. That was patronizing.</p>




<wip>(Gabbro says that the storms aren’t that bad and that thunder rarely ever strikes, it just stays in the clouds for the most part.)</wip>
<p>“The real danger you’ll want to look out for are the cyclones.”</p>


<wip>(Gabbro had set down the flute inside their hammock when they jumped out of it and stood up)</wip>
<p>“Wait, my flute–”</p>
<p>“—isn’t going anywhere, let’s go before that island gets any further!”</p>

<!--
Firn lands their ship on Statue Island thanks to Gabbro’s help in recognizing it. Firn can see the purple glow of the Nomai landing pad and is slightly surprised by the sudden pull pushing their ship upright and down to the surface.

Once on their way to Statue Island, Firn is very excited and impatient.
“Slow down, buddy,” Gabbro called out after them, only to be entirely ignored.
Hardly turning around for a split second, Firn’s only response was to retort “Wanna figure out what happened to you and Hal or not?”
With a sigh, Gabbro gave up on trying to remind them that their enthusiasm should not prevent them from keeping an eye on their oxygen level.



Firn climbs up the stairs nearby and follow the path, until they find a broken bridge leading to the other island. They run to build up some momentum, then activate their jetpack at the last moment in order to make it through, landing hard on the stone as they are still getting used to the increased gravity. They press their hands on their knees and pant a bit, then raise their head and notice that there is another gap. They grunt in exasperation.
<p>In this moment, Firn decided that Giant’s Deep sucked.</p>

// This is where they meet Gabbro, right in front of the statue and the closed door to the statue workshop. Gabbro is lying on the sand, using the smooth base of the statue as a makeshift pillow.
// “Hornfels asked me to stay here when they learned you were coming,” Gabbro sighed. “Said I could refill my oxygen with your ship, if you don’t mind me borrowing some air from your plants.”
// “Where else would you have wanted to go anyway?”
// “Back to camp, probably set up my hammock. I miss it already, and with that headache it’d be really welcome.” Not that they would have had the energy to do that before at least ten or twenty more minutes, though. Their island had soon drifted away from this one, and without their ship, they truly did not feel like swimming their way there when they could hardly even tell where either of the two had gone.




<p>“The sign reads ‘Statue Workshop’.” They turned their head to the door and grunted. “And the path is blocked, because of course it is.”</p>
<p>Gabbro took a few relaxed steps forward, nodding. “Oh yeah, it’s one of those Nomai airlocks or something. As you can tell, that one’s busted.” They watched as the new astronaut, undeterred, walked forward anyway and scratched at the edges of the stone, if only to try and see if they could take a peek at the other side; and after a few seconds, Gabbro crossed their arms and sighed. “Good luck trying to pry it open by force when it weighs twice the amount it already would on Timber Hearth, buddy. If you get squashed, I’m not pulling you out from under it.”</p>
<p>Firn let go and turned around, all four rolling eyes somehow radiating even past their visor. “I wasn’t gonna.”</p>
<p>“You were considering it.”</p>

CANON RELATED SHIP LOG ENTRIES:
- This island must be where the Nomai created statues like the one in our observatory.
- I found a Nomai statue lying on the beach. It looks just like the one in our observatory.
- I found a sign for a "Statue Workshop" next to a broken door that used to lead inside the island.


After talking and Gabbro begrudgingly accepting to come with, they follow another path along the beach and soon find a path of gravity crystals. However, the island gets picked up by a cyclone while they’re on the ground path in-between the two paths with gravity crystals, and this is how they end up in orbit.





(Gabbro commenting on Firn using their scout to take photos to send to their ship log, and writing down/ talking into their comm with the radio off before sending the message to their ship)
"New entry: Giant's Deep. Statue isla—"
If Gabbro had been startled by the unexpected words that were evidently not directed at them, they were even more surprised by the abrupt ending. Turning to Firn in a slight hurry, as theirs had been the voice to utter what they had just heard, they instantly noticed that the young cadet's hand was tinkering with the base of their helmet's aerial and that they had just turned off their radio; and when Gabbro gave a tentative tap on their shoulder, the hatchling's reaction was to give them a dismissive wave and turn around. Their radio being turned off mid-sentence explained what they had just heard, and the body language along with the fact that Firn started walking away from them confirmed that it was intentional.
Gabbro's curiosity was picked. Walking closer nonetheless, listening in this time not through the radio, but through the thickness of two helmets and a stormy atmosphere, Gabbro could almost associate the movement of their lips with concise and specific words. They could almost catch a whole sentence, thinking that what the hatchling said must have been something along the lines of *"...statues like the one in our observatory."* And then the hatchling raised the same hand to their helmet again. With the flick of a finger against the same button at the base of their aerial, their radio was turned back on; and along with the many connections it brought back, was the connection with their ship and the order to save the new file that had just been created. The hatchling gave a satisfied hum when their HUD displayed the words "SHIP LOG UPDATED."
The elders and not-so-elders all had a lot of gripes with a lot of things regarding Firn's attitude; but one thing that they could not ignore, and one of the main things that got them into the program along with their invaluable contribution in helping Hal make the Nomai translator a reality, was the fact that Firn was exceptionally thorough and methodical. They were a sarcastic brat who questioned authority more often than they listened to their answers, they were dangerously reckless, they were obnoxiously stubborn; but when it was about exploring the outer wilds and piecing together the mysteries their solar system harbored, they were taking the matter with the utmost solemnity. Where Hearthian society had failed to teach them respect, the universe itself had by proving to them how small of a pebble they all were, floating in the vastness of a whole lot of nothing.
Now finished with their note-taking, Firn turned to them and gave a sheepish laugh. "Sorry, I almost forgot to turn off my radio before starting. Didn't want to bother you with my ramblings."
"Turning off your radio is dangerous," Gabbro warned, "even if it's temporary. Why do you feel the need to do that?"
"Can't risk having someone speak through my comms while I'm editing," they mumbled, "that'd mess up the whole entry." "Also, it helps me focus."
They nodded. That made sense. "And then you turn it back on to send the file to your ship."
"Uh-huh."
Gabbro blew an impressed whistle. "Slate's sure got you spoiled with all those fancy gadgets."
Their laugh was this time an unrestrained bark of excitement. "Yeah, I'll have to thank them for that later. I'm gonna have *so* much fun with that feature."


<p>“There has to be another entrance somewhere,” Firn grumbled. Turning to Gabbro, they walked to their side and tugged at their arm insistently. “Come on. Hal was done recovering by this point, so should you.”</p>


Gabbro leads Firn to their own statue, right to the left of a closed door. The sign reads "Statue Workshop." They find a gravity crystal path and start walking up to it, hoping to find another entrance, but the cyclone takes the island around this moment, as they have no grip on anything, and they end up 1.6km away from GD's center.



(when the tornado takes statue island)
Firn was not given the chance to finish their sentence.
It started with the wind suddenly growing much stronger, sweeping them to the side with a violence much too strong for them to resist. It was only thanks to their quick thinking in using their downward thrusters that they managed, for a few seconds at least, to maintain their feet glued to the ground and not fall over entirely. These same few seconds were in the same moment busy with putting the translator away in order to both keep it safe and free their right hand, but to their dismay, they had already been thrust too far enough from the Nomai sign to be able to take a grip. And then, before they could process what was even happening, they fell to their knees as the ground shook and rose at high speed. Against their better judgement, Firn screamed.
Going in an instant from quadrupled gravity to none, feeling solid ground evade their feet, seeing it instead grow bigger and bigger, ready to collide with their face, they flailed about helplessly. Too disoriented to pay attention to the voices in their receiver, they only had a split second to find Gabbro reaching out for their hand, only to see his faraway blurry figure get accidentally kicked in the ribs and sent flying dozens of meters away by their own panicking limbs. With a gasp of guilt and panic, Firn flared up their thrusters to catch up after them, only to forget that during these few seconds, the gravity they had to fight against was no longer twice that of Timber Hearth, but falsely nonexistent.
They collided with Gabbro, hard. In trying to catch them, their grip on the joystick controlling their jetpack came loose. In turning their head violently in order to find and catch it again, their whole body started rolling into the vast void of space.
And then, finally, Gabbro blasted their way to them, succeeding in slowing down enough to avoid collision this time, and grabbed their leg. In a matter of seconds, they were back at eye level again, standing upright again, and…
…far up in orbit, at a high enough altitude to see Giant’s Deep’s curvature.
The treacherous island they had been investigating, briefly turned into a lift straight up to space, was nowhere in sight. It had most likely already made its way back to the surface, back to floating like a buoy, following the whims and fancies of the planet's flows and currents.

<p>They had embarked on a very, very slow descent, thanks to Giant’s Deep’s gravitational pull; but if Gabbro’s estimations were to be trusted and no island were to coincidentally come to them in the meantime, they would have ample time to die through suffocation long before they would through colliding with the planet. Maybe even twice.</p>
<wip>Gabbro locking on to Giant’s Deep:</wip>
<p>“…About sixteen kilometers from the center of mass.” With Giant’s Deep’s water surface standing on average at a radius of roughly five kilometers, this meant that this would be more than a whole ten kilometers drop. From this height and accounting for the increased gravity, even landing in water would likely be enough to cause at the very least a severe concussion; and being concussed while floating in the middle of a raging ocean was begging for the universe to end their life with slow and painful drowning, not even accounting for the cyclones.</p>

<!--



“Yeah, well…” Gabbro sighed. “Giant’s Deep has a lot of cyclones, you know? And they’re powerful enough to pull out entire islands right into space for a few minutes. Happens sometimes.”
“Only ‘sometimes’?” Firn parroted with a deadpan look. “I’ve been here for less than an hour and the whole <i>planet</i> already kicked me out!”
The first answer to their outburst was a noncommittal shrug. “Trust me, that really was a particularly big bout of bad luck. I’ve never got to see an island drift up so fast that we’d get basically catapulted into orbit before.”
Interrupting the older astronaut, Hornfel’s voice crackled through the radio, and Firn’s already tightly confined ears shuddered at the electric static. “Gabbro, status. Where are you?”
They tinkered with the buttons to the side of their helmet for a few seconds, trying to lock on to the center of the planet below their feet. “Uh, about [90] kilometers above the surface of Giant’s Deep. Currently in orbit.”
Hornfels let out a grunt filled with frustration and concern. “Fuel and oxygen?”
There was a second of heavy silence. “Bad.”
“Gabbro. I want <i>numbers</i>.”
“Fourteen percent fuel, two hours oxygen,” they relented tensely. Turning their helmet towards their fellow astronaut, they gave a tiny nod: “Firn?”
Gabbro could almost hear their lips trembling before they spoke. “…S-six percent, twenty-two minutes.”
A few seconds of muffled swearing crackled through the radio.

Firn looked down at the tumultuous clouds twirling below their feet from afar. “Can’t we just… try giving a small boost downwards and landing on Giant’s Deep again? That’ll be a big plunge, but it sounds better than staying in orbit. Both our ships are down there anyway.”
“If you want to gamble and think we’ll somehow be lucky enough to land <i>in water</i> rather than directly crash on land, to not be taken by <i>another</i> cyclone right after, to <i>somehow</i> be close enough to my camp so we can swim to the trees and refill, <i>without</i> using our jetpacks, and <i>before</i> we suffocate,” Gabbro detailed, raising one finger at each condition necessary for their survival to be even remotely conceivable, “then yes. Maybe. That’s one plan, I guess, but I really don’t like our chances.”
They gave a sarcastic huff. “And you think we have better chances staying up here till our oxygen runs out?”
Before Gabbro could respond, the static came back. “Riebeck is on their way, their ship should be in view in about [ten] minutes,” Hornfels’ voice soon rang out sharply. “Stay right where you are.”
The visor made it impossible to see their face, but Gabbro’s head tilt made it clear that they just <i>had</i> to be giving them a smug, patronizing expression. ‘And that’s how you do it the Gabbro way, rookie,’ Firn pictured it in their mind. Ah, yes, of course, the Gabbro way; making others do all the work in your stead.
“Gabbro, can’t you play something with your flute?” they soon pressed on. “Riebeck will need a signal to track if we want them to find us quickly.”
“Uh, I <i>would</i> play if, you know, it weren’t for the fact that a flute needs air to be heard. I can play in unbreathable atmosphere, sure, but it’s no use when there’s no atmosphere at all.”

“So— Are we <i>really</i> just gonna— stay like this and do <i>nothing?</i>”
“It’s just ten minutes, buddy, it’s not the end of the world.”

Their first trip should have been exciting. Their first trip should have been all about exploring space and translating words that no hearthian had ever read before. Their first trip should have been about proving that they were <i>competent</i>.
But they had barely gotten started on solving the mystery of the statues, and the planet itself had laughed in their face.

[Firn sees the probe station hovering close, less than a kilometer away above their heads, on an orbit barely any faster than theirs. The window of opportunity was small, but only a fool would refuse to take it.]

“See? I gave Riebeck a landmark to see from afar! I’m sure this thing’s big enough for their ship to be able to lock on to it too, perhaps even land on it.” Changing their radio’s frequency to that of Timber Hearth, they asserted proudly: “You heard that, Hornfels? I found us a much better spot to wait on. Riebeck will have a much easier time finding us now.”
Turning to the other stranded astronaut to their side, they felt like it was their turn to be smug.
Instead, Gabbro’s inexpressive helmet stared right into them, eerily still. “Buddy,” they scolded with what sounded like frozen terror, “your <i>oxygen</i>.”
They froze. Tilting their eyes to the top left corner of their vision, they looked at the tiniest chart displayed on their visor’s screen.
Nine minutes left.

The module Gabbro and Firn get stranded on is the Launch Module: in orbit with the Control Module, but being heavily damaged, cannot be accessed from the station's central hub, with its connection being broken. However, the module can be accessed from space by entering from the outside through the module's broken window. Details of overloading power to the cannon and only needing to be fired once are expanded upon here.

“Buddy, you’ll want to calm down if you want to have enough oxygen left by the time Riebeck arrives,” Gabbro advised with an unusually serious tone.
Firn gritted their teeth with a huff. “I <i>know</i> that, I’m not a <i>voidbrain!</i>” they shouted, offended by the patronizing.
But then, they realised that they were panting, and that knowing was not enough to actually apply it in reality. It was now as if they could feel their oxygen run out of their throat, all of it wasted by this stupid body who was breathing too fast to make any good use of it.
They were not even able to follow the most basic rule, the very first one Gossan had taught them, <i>staying calm</i> under any circumstances.
Yes. Yes, they were a rookie, <i>and</i> acting like a voidbrain. They were just a rookie, on their very first launch day, and they were about to die.
“Oh geez. <i>Ooh</i> geez,” [Firn starts panicking and grabs their helmet, as if their hands could pass through the visor and block their mouth, as if this could somehow prevent them from hyperventilating.]
[Gabbro takes them by the shoulders.] “Buddy. Look at me. Deep breaths,” “Deep… breaths. There’s this meditation technique, it’s good for minimizing your oxygen consumption. Follow my lead.”
[...]
“You’re doing good, keep at it,” Gabbro assured calmly. “You’ll see, rescue will be here before you know it.”

<wip></wip>
<p>“Gabbro, can’t you use your flute for Riebeck to pick up on?”</p>
<p>Gabbro raised their hands and showed their palms, both empty. “What flute? You didn’t let me take it when we left camp.”</p>
<p>Firn momentarily felt a great urge to slam their helmet against an open palm. Before they could act upon it, however, the full gravity of the situation fell upon them; and thus, only their chilling regret was expressed. “…Right. Sorry. Not my brightest moment.”</p>

<wip>Hornfels organises a rescue mission, trying to ask Riebeck to pick them up.</wip>
<p>A timid, uninvited yelp went to complete the harmony of their banjo, ending the melody on an abrupt note. <span class=radio>“A-a-and you want <i>me</i> to rescue them!? Hornfels, I’m sure we both want them to be <i>rescued</i>, not to end up with a third stranded astronaut! What if I c-<i>crash</i> my ship into that thing and kill them? Along with myself!?”</span></p>
<p>“Brittle Hollow is much closer to Giant’s Deep than any other planet with an astronaut on it,” Hornfels insisted gravely. “You are scared, not incompetent. There is no guarantee that Chert or Esker could arrive before they run out of oxygen. You are the only one who can make it in time.”</p>
<p>There were more ruffling sounds. This time, none of them could be identified as a banjo string being plucked. <span class=radio>“O-okay. Okay. I’m— I’m coming guys. Hang on tight.”</span> And as the sounds of quick pacing was picked up by the receiver, followed by a low gravity attempt at running, Riebeck added: <span class=radio>“Wish me luck. We’re all going to need it.”</span></p>

The launch module has:
- working gravity floor on ONE side. The other side does not work. The tracks, records and pool which would involve moving a vision ball are broken.
- A wall for Nomai writing for Launch Module x {insert stone}
- A projection pool for Launch Module x {insert stone}
- Projection stone: Probe Tracking Module
- Projection stone: Control Module
- Nomai trees but no oxygen.





[Riebeck upon arriving, sees Gabbro and Firn right in front of the broken glass. They immediately point at the dimly glowing floor inside the launch module:]
“Gabbro, I th-think those are gravity panels. Let’s go there, it’ll be much e-easier to refill when we’re not in zero-g.”



Riebeck:
“Now if you don’t mind, after we’re done exploring this part we’re going home. And staying on breathable, non-brittle ground, for a while,” Riebeck stated with a strangely calm voice—albeit calm with some form of hollow light-headedness. “You can take my ship if you want to bring yours back later and—and risk <i>your</i> lives again, <i>without me</i>.” “…No, for real though, please d-don’t risk your lives like this again. I can’t take it.”



[...]
“Hey, Riebeck,” [Gabbro says while handing them the projection stone] “that thing looks important.”
Riebeck lit up instantly, gasping in excitement. “A projection stone! I– At least I <i>think</i> that’s how the Nomai called them. I’ve always wondered how they worked.”
Firn looked up. “It was floating up there? I didn’t think you’d be able to tell it apart from the debris so fast.”
Gabbro shrugged. “Eh, it wasn’t that hard to find, with it glowing in the dark and all.”
[Riebeck eyes them, then the stone, then Gabbro again]
“Well, I guess it stopped glowing when you picked it up.”
[Gabbro frowned, but decided against arguing.]






Firn observes their surroundings, and at some point it clicks; they recognize that the ruins they are in are the exact ruins they witnessed blowing up as they woke up.
“This morning, the first thing I saw was a big flash of light right above me, maybe that’s even what woke me up,” they reasoned carefully, deep in thought. “From my perspective at the time, it was just in front of Giant’s Deep. Maybe it was orbiting it.” They raised their eyes to the other two astronauts, sparkling with curiosity and purpose: “I think— that could be it. We could be standing right inside the thing I saw blowing up.”



[When they both see Riebeck realize that they’re inside Nomai ruins with still usable technology:]
Firn was startled by the touch of a pat on their back. “Gonna give credit where it’s due, buddy, your idea did lead to a better outcome.” Huh. Hearing Gabbro, or <i>anyone</i> at all in Outer Wilds Ventures say that, felt more good than they had imagined. With a few smaller pats, though: “Still more reckless than geyser jumping. Feldspar would have been proud, and Gossan is gonna lose their mind if they’re ever told about this. And I don’t think you’ll manage to convince Hornfels not to.”
Firn rolled their eyes. “What are they gonna do, ground me?”
Their main answer was a shrug. “Just saying. Don’t give them ideas, especially not before you get to reunite with your ship.”
With a sigh, Firn gave up trying to think of any sass to retort to that. Their eyes soon wandered to Riebeck’s, and when they saw that one of their hands was following the spiral shape of some Nomai scriptures, they decided to come with and join in the fun, translator in hand. Riebeck was delighted beyond reason to realise that they could finally see the new shiny device in action, and even use it themself.
“Can you believe it? They were trying to send some kind of… probe, it seems?” they pondered while in the middle of their reading. “I can only imagine what its destination must have been, or how far it must have gone by now. This cannon seems to have been fired already, but that must have been done <i>ages</i> ago.”
[.]
“W-wait… I— I’ve <i>seen</i> that thing fire,” they realized with a shocked gasp. “<i>That’s</i> what saw when I woke up this morning!”
Riebeck turned to them all at once, translator in hand. Even with their helmet on, disbelief could be read all over their spacesuit.
“That’s impossible, and you must know it,” they replied simply. “The Nomai are long dead. Who could have possibly sent the order to fire now?”
“But— I know I saw something,” they insisted, bringing a hand to their forehead only to meet their visor in the way. They tried their best to remember what it had looked like… “It was right in front of Giant’s Deep, and it was something small that shot a purple light. I know I saw it.”
“Couldn’t that have been some kind of thunder?” Riebeck offered in a much gentler tone. “I’m not calling you a liar, I do believe you saw something. I just think… I-it’s just impossible for the source of that flash of light to be decrepit abandoned Nomai ruins where nobody in sight could have possibly activated it, could it?” “You say you were waking up, yes? M-maybe, you know… you just weren’t <span class=smol>awake enough t-to really know what it was.</span>”
Firn’s sense of logic tended to agree; at least at first glance, Riebeck was correct: they simply could not think of a way this cannon could simply fire on its own, hundreds of thousands of years after the civilization that had built it had died out. Any Nomai construct they had seen so far could only activate if there was <i>someone</i> nearby to use them, even when the Nomai statues had activated—
The statues.
Gabbro had found these statues weeks ago. They had been able to bring one back to Timber Hearth without it ever doing anything. Even when it had been accidentally chipped and the fallen chunk had been repurposed into their ship’s information storage at the heart of their computer, it had never given any sign of reaction to any of it. And then, one day, it had just… acted out on its own. Done <i>something</i> to Hal, whatever it was. Done something to Gabbro too, on the very same day.
The cannon had been fired first, though. The statues had not activated the cannon—if there truly were any correlation between these two events, and there had to be one, then if anything, the <i>cannon</i> had been the reason why the statues activated; not the other way around.
…This still left the lingering question of <i>what</i> had triggered the cannon, then.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Riebeck: “I heard there’s storms on Giant’s Deep, and that it’s not uncommon for the thunder to momentariliy color the clouds in pink or purple. Maybe you just saw a particularly big one?”
“That’s from Giant’s Deep’s surface though, not from the view I had on Timber Hearth.”
Without warning, their debate was interrupted by the sound of Gabbro intruding on their conversation, the static of their radio holding a chilling, uncharacteristic concern.
“Not to butt in, but… You guys seeing that?”
At first confused, both astronauts stared first at the finger they were pointing in the direction of deep space, then at the gigantic sphere of azure and blinding radiance they were pointing at from the other side of the broken glass window, ever expanding at high speed without any sign of stopping. In unison, they both missed a heartbeat.
“What— w-what <i>is</i> that!?” Riebeck shrieked.
Before anyone could answer, the whiteness reached them, and they were burned alive in an instant.



Firn teared their eyes away from their translator and up to the other side of the windows, frowning. "...Did the sky just get darker all of a sudden?"
Riebeck shrugged, opting to simply point their flashlight in their direction. "This structure is orbiting Giant's Deep, we must have reached its dark side. I sure can't see the sun from here."
Gabbro frowned in turn. "But we already <i>were</i> in the shadow of Giant’s Deep."
From pitch black, the echoes of the sun soon turned bright blue. Alas, none of the three astronauts were in a position to notice; and back on Timber Hearth, the rotation of the planet on its own axis had decided that, in this moment, sunset had passed and sunrise had yet to come.

<div id=loop2></div>
<div class=chp><h1>Loop 2 Stuff</h1><hr>
<wip>When the loop starts, Hal is frozen in place into a daze.<br>[description of the Nomai mask and the memories flashing, feeling like a dream yet also feeling far too real to truly be one.]</wip>
<p class=vs>When it finally finished and their vision cleared, their actual vision, Hal startled to the image of Gossan’s face, too little too close to their own for comfort, and to the touch of a glove holding their chin. As soon as this realization set in, the unexpected and unexplainable breach of their personal space caused them to jump backwards with a high-pitched yelp.</p>
<p>Gossan’s hand remained still and stuck in midair for a second or two, holding a chin that no longer was there, as they stared in shock; but soon, they brought their arm down to their side and sighed.</p>
<p>“<i>Finally</i>,” they heard the founder exhale, eyes briefly rising to the stars. The three eyes lowered instantly to stare back, and the next words they heard were clearly destined to them: “Oi, hatchling. You good?”</p>
<p>“Wha… What happened?” Hal wondered aloud, unsure whether they were consciously asking, or merely voicing their confusion to the void of the universe.</p>
<p>They jumped again at the touch of a hand clasping against their shoulder from behind.</p>
<p>“Welcome back to the living,” they heard Marl huff in their back, their dark humor failing to conceal the immense relief in their voice.</p>
<p>Hal frowned in confusion, mindlessly yet politely removing the uninvited hand of their cabinmate from their personal space. “Living…? What? D-did I just… <i>die</i>, or…?”</p>
<p class=vs>None of this made any sense. They still felt disoriented and in some form of daze, and yet all at the same time, everything felt so <i>lucid</i>– not just the present moment, but also what they were so certain had only occurred moments ago.</p>
<p>They could not shake away that feeling of intense, seething and <i>burning</i> heat…</p>
<!-- <wip>(Hal turns to Marl, carefully removing the hand from their shoulder, still trying to process what is going on.)</wip> -->
<p>Gossan stopped staring for a second or two, just long enough for them to instead send the lumbjerjack a death glare and wordlessly berate them for their indelicate and distressing statement, which <i>evidently</i> had no business whatsoever being uttered in such situation. “Of course not, since you’re still with us,” they clarified as soon as they could regain their soft tone. “But you sure gave us a good fright there.”</p>
<p class=vs>Hal looked around. It was nighttime. They could hear crickets. All three of them were standing near the patch of ghost matter, and even closer to the entrance of the zero-g cave.</p>
<p>What were they doing outside of the observatory? They had no memory whatsoever of walking out, and they least of all could think of any reason why they would have done so at such a crucial moment, when Firn and Riebeck were so kind to let them discuss their findings in real time.</p>
<p>After a few more seconds of looking around in stunned silence, Hal found themself with less answers and even more questions than they started with; and so, lips and all four eyebrows trembling, they asked again: “…What <i>happened?</i>”</p>
<p>“<i>You</i> tell us,” Marl scoffed in disbelief. “You’re walking like normal, Gossan says you even waved to them, and then just like that, you’re…”</p>
<p class=vs>Their sentence trailing off, Marl’s hands were raised as they seemed to search for the proper words. In the end, they gave up with a noncommittal shrug and remained silent for a few short moments, their head slowly shaking from right to left and their hands only conveying their support to their face’s full display of confusion and disbelief, punctuating their performance with a <i>“You know?”</i></p>
<p>Hal squinted and shook their head slowly, having understood absolutely none of it.</p>
<p>Marl crossed their arms and pouted. “Yeah, well, one more second of whatever that was, and I was on my way to fetch Porphy.”</p>
<p>Hal gave a tentative but still confused hum, staring at a firefly flying by as some kind of attempt to, paradoxically, remain focused and grounded in reality. The comforting presence of Gossan was brought back to their attention when the coach slowly came into their field of vision, mindfully ensuring to give them space now that they trusted the young Hearthian to not collapse on the floor or crumble to dust any moment.</p>
<p>“You have been completely unresponsive for at least a whole minute, perhaps even two,” they stated, putting as little worry into their voice as they could, but forgetting to watch the distress radiating from their three good eyes. “Nothing we did could snap you out of it.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t even pass out or anything, you really just <i>stood there</i>, upright, staring at nothing.” Marl had completely given up on trying to lie about the fact that the event had left them utterly freaked out.</p>
<wip>(Hal blinks slowly, still trying to process things, but not at all feeling light-headed or any physical symptoms. Only, perhaps, the phantom pain of whatever burning sensation they had woken up from.)</wip>
<p>“Well, I’m… fine now. I guess?”</p>
<p>“Sure you’re not gonna collapse to the floor? You need some water?”</p>
<p>They simply shook their head. If anything, in this moment, they somehow felt fresher than they had ever been. The vividness of the memories felt unreal in a far too aware way.</p>
<p>“I… I don’t know why I’m here, but I should go back to the observatory,” Hal mumbled. “Firn and Riebeck were exploring that structure orbiting Giant’s Deep, and—”</p>
<p>Gossan stared in disbelief. “Giant’s Deep? What are you talking about? Firn hasn’t even launched yet.”</p>
<p>The hatchling returned their stare right back at them, wearing the same expression. “…<i>What?</i>”</p>
<p>Gossan looked past the cliff, then pointed at a wooden structure in the distance, and more specifically, at a white contraption standing on top of it. “Their ship’s still there,” they stated flatly. Then, turning back to stare with full concern: “Are you <i>sure</i> you are doing alright?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m going to get Porphy,” Marl deadpanned. “Maybe a meteorite conked their head and it was just too small for us to see it.”</p>
<p>“T-to the observatory,” Hal blabbered quickly. The two Hearthians gave them a confused look, and they soon added with an unsure voice: “P-please. You can get them if you want, maybe I <i>do</i> somehow need some kind of medical attention, but— There is something I <i>have</i> to check there.”</p>
<p>Marl looked at Gossan expectantly, waiting for their input. Gossan looked at Hal’s pleading eyes, and their melting heart soon caved in. “…Fine. Marl, bring Porphy to the museum. I’ll make sure Hal doesn’t collapse on the way there.”</p>
<p>Hal released a breath they did not realize they were holding. “Thank you,” they heaved in relief.</p>
<p>It was, by all means, just a hunch. But if Firn had never launched– if none of what Hal was somehow so certain they had lived through had in fact been real– if there was <i>physical evidence</i> proving that everything from the past three sunrises had been naught but some kind of daydream or hallucination… Then surely, what they would find at the very entrance of the museum would prove their visions wrong, just like everything else.</p>
<hr>
<p>The statue did not prove them wrong.</p>
<p>Jaw falling to the ground as soon as the Nomai statue’s shape became clear enough to show its golden, <i>open</i> eyes, Hal made Gossan yelp in surprise when they suddenly gasped and sprinted forward.</p>

<!--
# Loop 2:
Firn walks up to them as they’re talking:
"Hey Hal! Hornfels," they saluted with a cheerful wave and a polite nod. "I won’t bother you for long, I'm just here for the launch codes."
"Don’t mind me, I'm just here for the launch codes."
That was when it finally clicked.
Hal seized both of Firn's shoulders in their grip, forcing them to face them. They both stared at each other intently, one with worry and extreme confusion, the other with distress; but Hal's mouth, though barely open, found itself numb and unable to speak.
"Hal, are you... alright? What's going on?"
Hal wished they could answer. They wished they could answer and not fear countless unfortunate outcomes in the same moment.


Starts of loop: Hornfels starts in the observatory, prepping the last measurements for checking flight conditions. They walk down to the statue room about 10-20min in, meaning that Hal can stop them from seeing the statue if they come fast enough.



The statue’s eyes were open.
[Hal considers first telling Hornfels about it, but when they climb to the observatory, they catch Hornfels’ conversation with Gabbro about having died and being metaphorical, where they learn that Gabbro also remembers the previous loop.]
With this sentence alone, all thoughts related to the statue were unceremoniously discarded.
[Hal reminisces Gabbro’s words, Firn and Riebeck’s panic as they replied and followed and saw <i>something</i> that no person standing in the ground control office could have, the pain of the supernova, the intense burning that had lasted but an instant and yet had been so painful.]
Had they died? They were not sure, but regardless of that answer, they certainly had felt <i>something</i>.
And thus, their hands twitched as they step forward, and they made their presence known before the more reasonable part of their brain could convince them otherwise. “I— I remember dying too.”





Loop 2+:
Hornfels asking Firn what they intend to do in space:
"Ah, I think I'll start small with the Attlerock, just to make sure I've got all the controls right." "Besides, I'm dying to know what kind of device the Nomai were calibrating there, and I bet Hal is too."
(Sees Hal's distraught expression.)
They stared back, frowning in confusion. "...Or not? Is there something wrong?"




(Check how much this makes sense. Else keep for a later loop)
Hal lets them go, too heartbroken to tell them about the time loop. Firn is suspicious and worried, but takes the codes and says they might use their first flight to visit Esker and the Attlerock ruins.
Hal, Hornfels and Gabbro keep talking about the statues and the time loop(?); but then, later on, Firn radioes them.
"Uh, guys, call me crazy but... How do I put this." Their voice crackled through the receiver, both due to the reception and their evident unease. "I was about to write down some notes about the Nomai writings I translated on the Attlerock, but then I— I noticed that... there already *were* notes? Written by me? That I don’t remember writing? Th-they talk about some Nomai statues on Giant's Deep, and..." "Hal, it's. This is my Launch Day, right? This is my *first time in space*, right?"



When Firn gets their ship back on TH, their landing is not by any means what one could call graceful. Slate cringed at the particular sounds of multiple specific pieces of finely manufactured equipment being mercilessly crushed under the weight of an improperly balanced spaceship.

From a different receiver, everyone could practically hear the eyebrow Gabbro had just raised. "Huh, would you look at that. Third one who remembers something that didn’t happen… sort of."
Hornfels asks Firn to come back to Timber Hearth immediately. When they arrive, they and Hal enter the ship to look at the ship log and verify that, indeed, there are entries describing what Hal and Gabbro remembered doing.
"That’s not all," Firn announced with a gulp. "Look at the timestamps."
"...They’re… from hours in the *future?* That can't be," Hornfels wheezed breathlessly.
"It d-did take them the whole day to investigate," Hal blabbered.
"Unless Slate changed something, all ships rely on (Ol Spacey) to calculate universal time. Is this computer broken, or— N-no, it looks perfectly fine..."
Hal brought a shaking hand to their forehead, almost stumbling from some kind of vertigo. "This... Stars, it really did happen. The sun really blew up."
A heavy silence fell in the room. Firn's eyes shifted from one to the other, to the computer screen, back to them, shuffling their feet uncomfortably.
"You guys... think it'll do that again this time around?"
Hornfels politely but shakily tried to shove the youngsters away from their path as they tried to exit the ship. "I will contact Chert. I asked them to update the star charts—It appears there is a star that needs far more scrutiny now than any other."

Firn writes down their first personal message to their future self here? Mostly as a "I just hope I'll look at this tomorrow and ponder if I actually lost my mind. Would be better than the alternative."

A pause.
"I saw it again."
Hal blinked, staring up at the receiver as if they could see Firn’s face through it.
"Saw what?"
"The— the thing. The cannon in my notes. First thing I saw when I woke up—it exploded. Again." "It happened just like my notes said it."

[
"That would come with the time loop, I suppose."
"Did the statue act up again?"
A pause.
"Its eyes were already open when I came to check."
]

Loop 2:
- Hal jolts awake, shaken by the supernova, and looks around, shocked to realize where they are. They notice the statue’s eyes are open, and go ask Hornfels to verify that, indeed, the statue’s eyes were not open before, confirming that they did not hallucinate that part.
- Gabbro radioes Hornfels while Hal is still here and asks whether they died too, and Hal gasps upon realizing that the past loop did indeed happen.
- Firn arrives to ask for the launch codes, and Hal is devastated to see that they don’t remember anything about having gone to Giant’s Deep.
- It hadn’t clicked yet for Hal that Hornfels did not remember because at the time they were still thinking that, somehow, it had been some sort of weird dream.

Thanks to having access to Ground Control and Hornfels, Hal is capable of giving orders and indications to pretty much every traveler. However, they will still require Firn most of the time due to the ship log’s ability to keep track of things, while Hal cannot take any notes that will last otherwise. Also, only Firn has the Nomai translator.



Gabbro asking Hornfels if they died too:
“Gabbro, if this is about the time when you asked me if each moment is the death of our past self and the birth of our future self, then you already know my thoughts about this kind of metaphor. You’re in space to do some field work, not some philosophical ponderings like these.”
Somehow, as they answered, Gabbro’s voice sounded rushed and genuinely confused. “N-no, wait, I wasn’t…” But their sentence trailed off; and soon, with a sigh, they concluded: “…Never mind.”
Hal still was unsure what had occurred just a few minutes earlier, but what they knew was that <i>something</i> had happened, and somehow only they seemed to have noticed. Unless… unless Gabbro had, too. “I— I remember dying too,” they blurted out into the microphone.
Hornfels turned to them with four shut slits instead of eyes. “What are you talking about?”
“Oh, cool! So it wasn’t just me,” Gabbro piped up with a speck of enthusiasm. “One moment I’m in some kind of Nomai structure in orbit ‘till I spot some kind of big white light, and… I think that was the sun? Exploding on us?” “Then the weird statue thing happened again, and next time I opened my eyes, I was back here—on Giant’s Deep, I mean.”
Hornfels stared at the microphone as if a bramble seed had just taken over it.
“I— I know it sounds crazy, and I don’t even know <i>what</i> happened,” Hal blabbered nervously. “But one minute we were right here talking to them while Firn and Riebeck were studying the Nomai ruins Gabbro just talked about, and the next… I think for one second everything got <i>really</i> hot. But it was over the next second and I was right back outside the museum, <i>somehow</i>. I— I don’t remember walking out of there, how was that possible?”
“Both of you are pulling my leg, aren’t you,” Hornfels simply deadpanned. In return, their answer was Hal’s even more blasé stare. They crossed their arms. “That would be a first, I know, but whatever you two are spouting makes absolutely no sense, and I am not going to fall for it.”

Hornfels stared as if Hal’s forehead had just grown a fifth eye.






"Hornfels!" Chert exclaimed, pleasantly surprised. "I'm updating the star charts, like you asked. I've got some amazing luck today, I've somehow managed to catch two supernovae in just the last twenty minutes!"
"Forget about the other stars," Hornfels shook their head tensely. "Can you take a closer look at the sun?"
[..]
"What's wrong with the sun?"
"Just answer the question."
Chert paused for a few seconds, and when sound resumed, it was rather noise caused by the tinkering of various instruments. Finally, after a few minutes, they concluded: "It looks... <i>somewhat</i> redder than usual? But— no, it’s surely because you’re making me look for something, I can’t be impartial."
Hal bit their lip. "If... Imagine it was about to go supernova. How long does it look like it would take before it happens?"
"Ha, ha, very funny. There's no way it will happen in our lifetimes, is there?"









At some point after getting confirmation that the ship log works, Firn will change the setting so that the ship log screen will flash and show the TL;DR (so the in-game ship log) first thing they do, making it impossible for them to not notice provided they use their ship. This would be at a point when Firn is convinced that there is an infinite time loop, so it isn’t this early.

<div class=chp><h1>Loop 3</h1><hr>

<p>“<i>Finally</i>,” they heard the founder exhale, eyes briefly rising to the stars. The three eyes lowered instantly to stare back, and the next words they heard were clearly destined to them: “Oi, hatchling. You good?”</p>
<p>Hal stared, mouth agape. By the time they could almost find their words, the voice of Marl resonated behind their back, eerily familiar.</p>
<p>“Welcome back to the living,” they heard with a mixture immense relief in their voice.</p>
<p>Looking at one Hearthian then the other in turn, Hal took a step back away from both, staggering. “It– <i>again?</i>” they blabbered.</p>
<p>Gossan frowned, carefully closing the space between them all the while trying not to intrude. “What do you mean, ‘again’?”</p>
<p>They blinked repeatedly as they turned around, taking in their surroundings. Patch of ghost matter, Marl behind them, zero-g cave right by them, Gossan having once again been holding their chin. The bottom of their eyelids twitching nervously, they turned again to Gossan and repeated, with more assurance: “It happened again.”</p>
<p>Marl’s voice came in from behind. “What, you’ve already had those freaky ‘I’m a statue’ episodes before?”</p>
<p>“N-no— …Yes? B-but I mean—” Hal retreated further until their back hit the rocky wall of the mines. “<i>This</i>. This scene. We’ve had this happen before.”</p>
<p>Marl and Gossan exchanged confused and worried glances. Marl found their voice first: “Hal, what are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“You don’t… remember?” Hal shook their head. “That was barely three sunrises ago…”</p>
<p>Then it came flooding back, everything sounding painfully obvious in hindsight. The lack of recollection from Hornfels and Firn too. The clock having been all weird. Firn’s <i>ship log</i> having data from the future…</p>
<p>Hal’s fingers dug into the stone, feeling like the Hearthians in front of them were some kinds of corporeal ghosts.</p>
<p>They needed to tell Gabbro. <i>Gabbro</i> had not forgotten anything last time it happened.</p>
<p>Gossan caught their arm, worry and panic flooding their face. “Whoa there, where are you going? Hal, given what just happened and how pale you still are, you should go see Porphy and make sure you didn’t catch something nasty.”</p>
<p>“I-<span class=scaps>i</span>’m fine!” they cried out much louder than they had intended to. “P-please let me go!”</p>
<p>Gossan’s eyes widened when they realize just how terrified Hal looked; when they realized what they were so terrified of.</p>
<p>Somehow, for some unfathomable reason, the young Hearthian was terrified of <i>them</i>.</p>
<p>At a loss for what to do, Gossan released their grip and took a gentle step back. Hal shakingly retracted their newly freed arm and took it to their chest, clutching it with their other hand. Their glassy gaze was staring right back, and although none of the terror had left, Gossan hoped that the glimmer of gratitude they thought they could see was more than just a figment of their imagination.</p>
<p>“I h-have to– the observatory,” the hatchling mumbled as they trembled. “<i>Please</i>.”</p>
<p>The coach and lumberjack exchanged a concerned glance. Mercifully, Gossan turned back to them and slowly nodded. “If you insist. But let me accompany you.” There was a tense pause, as their lips pondered some more words. Eventually, they felt the need to specify: “…From a distance, if you prefer.”</p>
<p class=vs>Hal’s ears flickered and flattened, but they pressed their lips together, gulped, and shakingly returned the nod.</p>
<p>Better than nothing.</p>

<wip></wip>

<p>Gossan gave a heavy sigh, trying not to be intrusive, but clearly wanting to be involved. “Is there any way you could explain what any of this was about?”</p>
<p>Hal arms tightened around their chest; but, reluctantly, they nodded. “We’ve… I tried to say it. This– this whole thing with you and Marl. It already happened. I was on my way to the observatory— but I’ve already <i>been there</i> today. <i>Twice</i>.”</p>
<p>Gossan’s good eyes squinted, though they did not dare interrupt.</p>
<p>“Something happened,” the hatchling continued. “Or… is <i>going</i> to happen? I’m not quite sure either. It’s like… time itself has been acting all weird and wrong this morning. And like I’m the only one on this planet who noticed.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Hal repressed a sob. “You– don’t believe me, do you.”</p>
<p>Gossan did not respond. When Hal glanced at them, the coach was avoiding their gaze.</p>
<p>“I-it’s okay,” they assured with a broken laugh, “I know it sounds crazy. I wouldn’t believe myself either.”</p>
<p>More silence, though it did not last nearly as long. The tone was almost too low for Hal to make out the words, but they were pretty sure they heard the founder mumble to themself that <i>“If Firn roped you in another of their jokes, you’re really taking this one way too far.”</i></p>
<p class=vs>Hal’s fists clenched and shook. Firn’s <i>pranks</i> were often at the expense of others, and they, but even they would never stoop that low— and Hal was not <i>this</i> easy to manipulate and trick into involuntarily pulling on an act this serious, for this long.</p>
<p>If <i>Firn</i> had been the one to come to them and tell them the story of time breaking down and everyone forgetting about it, Gossan's doubts would have been more than justified, and Hal themself would not have believed a single word of it, because nice and suggestible as they were, they were not <i>stupid</i>. But, in their defense: contrary to them, Firn had a <i>history</i> as a crafty, resourceful, and creative prankster. If Hal had any history, it was a history of <i>being</i> pranked.</p>
<p class=vs>Besides, everyone knew that Hal had rarely ever been a voluntary ‘actor’ during those pranks, and that they were rather just gaslit and being played like a fiddle until they realized they had been partaking in the setup from the very beginning. Hal’s good acting skills only stemmed from their own lack of confidence and its resulting gullibility.</p>
<p>This time, however, was different. Unless Firn had somehow figured out how to magically bend time itself, that was, and unless on top of this they had completely shed any sense of compassion for their friends and caretakers. For these two reasons alone, on top of a mountain of others, Hal knew that this was simply <i>impossible</i>.</p>
<p>The fact that Gossan would even <i>dare</i> think of the possibility… It hurt. It hurt in so many ways.</p>
<p>“I promise Firn has nothing to do with this. Last time, they didn’t remember anything either, and they–” Pause. A pained gulp. “…They didn’t believe me either when I tried to tell them.” Inhaling sharply through their nose, they turned around all at once and gave an accusing look. “Gossan, how do you even <i>expect</i> Firn to somehow be able to wipe other people’s memories!? If anyone’s being pranked here, it’s me! By all of you!”</p>
<p>The two exchanged a long glare. Truth and trust, in silence and mutual respect, clashed like blades in the starlight. Gossan’s determination, to their own shock, was the first to waver.</p>
<p>With a lost sigh, they relented and asked: “What are you hoping to find in the observatory?”</p>
<p>Hal gulped. “Gabbro,” they responded. “Through the, um. Through the radio, of course.” They looked down, trembling. “…Hopefully.”</p>
<p>Gossan tilted their head, having heard pretty much the <i>last</i> thing they would have put on their list of guesses. “Why them?”</p>
<p>Hal’s lips twisted into a small, pained smirk, sighing darkly. “Because if <i>I’m</i> the one partaking in the joke, then they’re the one I’m teaming up with this time.”</p>



</div>

Loop 3+:
Hornfels: "Since when are you invested in getting any kind of work done?"
Gabbro: “Even broken clocks are right twice a day,” somehow managing the exact same audible shrug as the last loop.
“That and I don’t think the time loop is really giving them much of a choice,” Hal sighed.

Gabbro advises Hal not to tell Hornfels about the time loop.
“We’re gonna have to tell them anyway when your buddy sees their ship log,” they sighed. “Trying to explain it once every few hours is already going to be a pain, imagine having to explain it <i>twice</i> per loop.”
By Loop 3, Gabbro recommends Hal to not tell Hornfels about the time loop until Firn finds out; which contributes to Hal feeling like they can’t even be honest until halfway through the loop.



Hal’s lower left eye twitched. They had heard that before, and this felt wrong. This was just… completely *wrong.*
Firn had always been known for two things: for one, they were sarcastic; but most importantly, they were *unpredictable*. (resourceful?)
What they had just heard this time had not been just the same words—they had used the exact same tone of voice, the exact same gestures, with the exact same timing right down to a fraction of a millisecond.
It made sense, Hal knew it, and they knew that they should have anticipated it; but it was still *wrong*.
While too dumbfounded to openly react, their ears picked up on the sound of Hornfels giving, they too, the exact same words and actions that they had displayed less than four hours prior. Hal glanced from the corner of their top right eye, and just as they should have known, Hornfels found the launch codes on the exact same note as the last two times, in the exact same state and location as before.
The fact that, in this room, only they seemed to have any idea that anything at all was so *wrong*, made them nauseous. Surely Gabbro would have given a reaction if they had been standing in this room, and not kilometers away on another planet, right? Surely they could not be the only one seeing this scene unfold under their eyes and feel like they were trapped with ghosts of the past…
But also, even if they had been standing in this room, how could they ever expect a reaction of any kind from *Gabbro?* They had seen the sun itself *explode*, according to their account — *twice*, even — and yet they had been… so relaxed about it all, as they always were. Out of all emotions they could have possibly expressed, were they confused and lost by the logical intricacies of the predicament they were in? Of course. After all, strange as they were, they still had *some* common sense.
But now, shocked, distraught, horrified? Hal hoped that the only reason they could not detect any of it was because they could not see the Hearthian face to face.





Loop 3: Hal tries to convince Firn to visit something other than the Attlerock, and when they’re not convinced, Hal mentions the statue; but then, instead, Hornfels walks down the stairs and forgets the comms, therefore leaving Firn to visit the Attlerock. It is Gossan who shows up at some point, because Firn had tried to radio Hornfels, and when Hornfels did not respond, they tried to radio Gossan instead.
“Firn, listen, the statue’s eyes opened, and–”
If a Nomai statue’s eyes had opened, Hornfels’ widened ten times more. “Its eyes—! Hal, why didn’t you say so earlier!?”
Before Hal could even attempt to answer that question, the curator had already disappeared to the floor below, completely abandonning the ground control post.
“Wait, no– <i>Hornfels!</i> Hornfels, come back!”
Firn placed a comforting hand around their shoulder (which did nothing except for send a shiver down their spine), laughing softly. “Relax. I don’t need to be kept on a leash to still be safe in space. I can totally take off without them.”
Hal was trembling too much to find in them the capability to reply that, surprisingly enough, Firn’s flight capabilities were currently the least of their worries.
(Firn and Hal go down the stairs after them. They exchange a few words, then Firn is ready to leave. Hal tries to stop them, but Hornfels catches their arm in excitement, asking them to tell them everything about what they saw with that statue.)
“Have fun, you two!” Firn snickered before they turned around and waved them goodbye without looking, stepping out of the museum with an entusiasm loud enough to drown out the sound of Hal’s desperate attempts at calling after them.
—
Much later, Gossan arrives and glares at Hornfels for not being at their job.
“Hornfels, I hate to disrupt your fascinating research, but may I ask what you are doing <i>away from the comms</i> on Firn’s first launch?”
“Gossan? What brings you here?”
Gossan tapped at the radio on their belt. “Firn tried to contact ground control. When they couldn’t get to you, they tried getting to me instead.” “Hornfels, again– What are you doing here instead of upstairs, making sure they’re doing alright? You’re lucky they didn’t sound <i>injured</i> when they called me.”
Hornfels looked evidently displeased by the distraction, but sighed and slowly went for the stairs, mumbling to themself that Firn had better not have crashed somewhere and be asking for a rescue mission.
Gossan’s three eyes turned to the other Hearthian next to them, tone now softer but traits on their face just as grave as before, if not with even deeper creaks.
“You should come with, Hal,” they sighed tensely. “Firn said they wanted to talk to you specifically.”

Firn’s “diary” ship log entries can be shown at the end of each loop until the moment when they get locked behind a password. After this point, no longer show them and keep everything for post-sun station and try your best to make the audience forget about them.

<p>“Welcome back to the living,” Marl soon came in, just as oblivious as the previous time.</p>

<p>Ears flattening all the way to their shoulders, Hal closed their eyes tightly shut and gritted their teeth, heaving a tired sigh. “Hi, you two. I’m <i>fine</i>. Forget it.”</p>

Hornfels: "Since when are you invested in getting any kind of work done?"
Gabbro: "Even broken clocks are right twice a day," somehow managing the exact same audible shrug as the last loop.
Hal is upset that Gabbro would dispell Hornfels’ doubts the exact same way as the previous time.
Hal panics, thinking that Gabbro somehow lost their memories; but when they hear them asking about a different planet than the previous loops, picking up on the previous loop’s plan, they’re relieved, then annoyed. “Gabbro, you can’t start doing it too!”
“Doing what?” There was a pause. A metaphorical blink of realization. “…Oh.” Then a sigh. “Re<i>lax</i>, I’m still with you here.”
“Then why did you just—!?”
"Saying that worked just fine the last time," they retorted with a disappointed sigh. "You're the one wasting time here."
“What are you two talking about?”
Hornfels asks what this is supposed to mean, and Gabbro ignores them with an audible eyeroll.
“See what I mean? We could’ve gotten started with the real dirt a full minute ago with a lot less hassle if you’d just let me say that <i>one</i> sentence.”
“So you’re doing this because you can’t be bothered?”
“Because it’s more <i>efficient</i>.” And absolutely because they could not be bothered too, yes, but admitting it was just going to be counterproductive.

“You could’ve at least gone with a warning.”
“I told you last loop not to tell Hornfels, thought that was enough.” A small pause. “Sorry if that wasn’t clear. And, uh, sorry for all that, Hornfels. Guess now we <i>have</i> to tell you this time too, after all.”
“If I am… gathering well…” Their sentence trailed off, as they squinted and shifted their eyes from Hal to the radio receiver back and forth.
“A time loop?” Hal offered with a sheepish shrug.
“Yes. That can’t be right.”


“Hey Hal! Hornfels,” “Don’t mind me, I’m just here for the launch codes.”
"Of course," Hornfels said happily. "I have them written down somewhere around here, just let me find the note–"
"That one?"
Hal remembered where the note had been on the last loop, and had pointed towards without thinking. They might as well save a few seconds.
Hornfels blinked in surprise, following the hatchling's pointing finger and, indeed, finding the object of their search instantly. "...Why, thank you, Hal. I didn’t know you were so observant."
Hal simply kept their mouth shut, pressing their lips together in a thin line and taking a deep inhale through their nose.

<p>Hal bypassed Gossan without answering and ran up the road to the observatory before Marl could open their mouth.</p>
<p>Both stared in disbelief. The lumberjack pursed their lips and offered a hypothesis with a noncommittal shrug: “Think they just remembered they forgot something important?”</p>

Hornfels: "Since when are you invested in getting any kind of work done?"
Gabbro: "Even broken clocks are right twice a day," somehow managing the exact same audible shrug as the last loop.
One pair at a time, Hal rubbed their eyes with two exhausted fingers and tried not to audibly groan.



"Don’t mind me, I'm just here for the—"
Hal swiftly grabs the slip of paper Hornfels would usually give them and gives it to Firn before they can finish.
"...launch codes. Uh. Thanks, Hal."
Seeing that their friend was too shocked to think of actually taking the slip of paper, Hal realized that their actions may have appeared a lot more impatient and insensitive than they had intended.
They brought their arm back to their side and looked down. They had crumpled the note in their hurry, and even though they had to still be readable, they felt bad all the same. It wasn’t like them to act so careless. "…Sorry. I– We were in the middle of something." They were annoyed, sure, perhaps rightfully so, but… At the end of the day, it still wasn’t their fault. "I didn’t think…"
"No, no, it’s okay," Firn cut in while shaking their head in relief and reaching out for the note, "I didn’t want to interrupt whatever you were working on. It seems important."

<div class=chp><h1>Loop 6</h1><hr>

<!--
Hornfels: "Since when are you invested in getting any kind of work done?"
Gabbro: "Even broken clocks are right twice a day," somehow managing the exact same audible shrug as the last loop.

Hal asks Gabbro to get them out of here and loses it.




There is no access to the roof of the observatory, so in Loop 6, Firn rather takes Hal down the stairs, through the statue's room, and then sits on the ground by the nearby waterfall.







First few loops, Hal stays at the observatory; but after they had to deal three or four times with Hornfels repeating the same thing (being surprised at their radioing Gabbro, and being confused by everything they talk about), and with Firn taking some time to pass by, ask Hornfels for the launch codes, maybe have a word about the statue, Hal will have enough.
(Hornfels is about to repeat the same line as always, but Hal gets to the radio first and breaks down.)
“Gabbro, get me out of here,” they hurriedly cried into the microphone. “I-I can’t do this. I can’t <i>do</i> this.”
The radio crackled for a moment.
“…I get you, pal. But what… do you want me to do? Fish you out of the village?”
“I don’t know!” they cried out in desperation, giving up on trying to think of the means or consequences. “Anything but <i>this!</i>”
// “I’m begging you. I *can’t* deal with this every time.”
(A painful sympathetic pause) “…My ship was taken in a cyclone before the loops started, buddy. I would if I could, but…”
Hal’s mouth opened and slowly gaped.
Finally. <i>Finally</i>, they realized the real reason why Gabbro had been dragging their feet so much instead of taking their predicament seriously.
“You don’t know where it is,” they wheezed in pain and disbelief. “You lost— You’re the only other Hearthian who remembers— You’re the only astronaut who could possibly be of any use, and you *lost your ship*.” A sob came and strangled their breath. Shaking their head, a despaired whisper escaped their throat. “What did I do to get stuck with *you* of all people?”
From the side, with minute wariness, Hornfels bent forward to meet their gaze. “Hal, what on Hearth is…?”
Air whizzled through their teeth. “Not now, Hornfels. *Please*.”
(Firn comes by, asking for the launch codes.)
“Hey Hal! Hornfels,” they greeted respectively with a friendly wave and a polite nod. (repeat the exact sentence as usual).
Hal gritted their teeth, shaking their head and feeling a sarcastic (rictus) slashing their face. "Don’t mind me, I’m just here for the launch codes."
Firn stopped dead in their tracks. It was only when their mouth closed that Hal realized that this sad imitation of the (puppet) which used to be their best friend, had actually been said out loud.
With two pairs of eyes still wide and too full with shock to express any other kind of emotion, Firn pointed at their friend a joking but shaky finger, and a teasing but in reality intensely distraught (freaked out) smile. "...I don’t know how you did that, but please never do it again. That was beyond creepy."
Hal could only stare back in disbelief.
Never do it again? Creepy?
Oh, the <i>irony</i>.

(Firn says something about . Gabbro makes a comment about Hal needing to calm down?)
Their head hurt. The mere sight of the ground control room, of the always static positions of the same Hearthians in the same places in circular space and time, was now making them nauseous.
Two of these Hearthians were now staring at them in shock. But why should they even care? These two would forget everything in a matter of hours, only to redo it all over again.
"Just go to the Attlerock, Firn," they mumbled hysterically, "the South pole locator needs you for the–the however many times you've been there."
Firn's eyes furrowed, "How'd you know I planned—"
"And then you'll try to write down some notes, and you'll see that your ship already has logs you don’t remember writing down, and you'll radio Hornfels, saying how weird it is, and then I'll have to tell you about the statues and the time loop and the *sun* all over again–"
"The sun–?" Hornfels parroted under their breath, only to be ignored by everyone, themself included,
"–because yes the sun is going to explode just like it did before, and how is anyone supposed to stop a *supernova* when the only one who remembers anything and should be able to do *some*thing about it has *lost their ship*—"
What stopped their tirade was Firn taking a strong grip on their hands, squeezing them tightly.
Hal did not look up. They could not– they dared not imagine what kind of face this ghost was making, let alone look at it.
"I— Okay I didn’t follow everything." Good, they likely shouldn’t have. "But I– You— What..." Firn shook their head. "No, I'm not gonna ask."
There was another squeeze, while they turned their head away and to the side: "Hornfels, I don’t know what you two were doing, but can I borrow Hal for a minute? They— Looks like they need some fresh air."
Wordlessly, mouth still agape, Hornfels simply nodded, letting know in their flabbergasted expression that they did not think their permission even needed to be asked.

There was a gentle but firm tug on their arms, and before Hal knew it, they were on the observatory's rooftop. Looming over the crater was a star that still looked normal so far, but would soon be the blight to kill them all; only for the cycle to repeat.
"So. Uh." A sharp breath, a pair of hands letting go and deciding instead to violently clutch the (rambarde) separating them from an immense, somehow almost tempting fall.
Firn was still fumbling with their words. This was quite uncharacteristic of them, of how Hal remembered their best friend to be. But at least this was not... This was not a hollow echo of the things they would usually say.
There was silence. Hal did nothing to break it. It was the first time since this statue had acted that they were finally granted peace, and only in this instant did they realize how much they had needed it.
Perhaps the ghost of their best friend had, for once, said something actually helpful.
"You... Hal, you said– a *time loop*."
Seemed like silence break was over. Drats.
Firn let go of the (rambarde) and turned back to them, eyes shifting between concern and disbelief.
"I'm... Look, I can't just take your word– ugh." They were skeptical for sure... but they seemed to be at least considering it.
Then again, what did it even matter? Just a couple hours and they would be back to blissful ignorance, and Hal back to a loneliness worse than absolute isolation would cause.
"Hal, I know you might want to get back at some of my jokes, but this *really* isn't funny."
Well, it seemed like they had settled for not believing them. In all honesty, they weren’t going to blame them for it. Logic was dictating that they were far more likely to be clinically insane.
And so they gave a painful snicker. "Hard agree."
Firn paused and looked at them expectantly, as if they were waiting for them to say anything more, such as something along the lines of *"Trust me, it's even less funny from my perspective."*
They were waiting for nothing. There was no such thing to say. Not to someone who was not taking them seriously, and not to someone who, even after being convinced somehow, would forget in no time.
"Whatever was going on in there was driving you crazy mad, huh?" Unfortunately, Firn had never been the kind to let go of anything without a hard fight. "If I were you, I'd probably have just busted my way out to get some fresh air and get it all out. Maybe setting a little thing or two on fire to vent the frustration if it really was that bad."
Hal gave a short huff through their nose, unsure themself whether it was out of annoyance, or if it was some sort of small repressed laugh.
Whatever the case, they still remained silent and unmovable. Firn was stubborn, but they too could be.
...Or at least, Hal thought they were until Firn grabbed their shoulder and forced them to turn around, face to face with their hardened expression.
"The Attlerock," they asserted with as few tremors as they could afford, trying to trade their apprehension for determination. "Wanna come with?"
Hal froze, only realizing a second too late that their eyes had grown, showing an actual emotion for the first time in what felt like far too long.
"Me? In *space?*"
The breaking of their mask, as well as their distraught answer, instantly made a corner of Firn's lips tilt upward, showing a small smug and trumphant grin. "What, you never tried *that* in your time loop?" ...Smug, triumphant, and as always, full of sarcasm.
Firn’s raised eyebrow showed as much skepticism as they could muster; and yet, they were unable to conceal in their voice the fact that both their concern and offer were genuine.
Hal looked down, over the edge, past the rusted (tôles).
(Something about Hal being excited, but also terrified of space; not having any training at all.) They were not nearly as afraid of space as Riebeck was, but this was putting the bar at tripping height. And still, they had never been interested enough to attempt any kind of training, mostly out of being curious about space, but not fascinated about it; about being more interested in the Nomai than about the travels, and preferring to see the artifacts fall right into their hands with each traveler flying back home.
All in all, they were a linguist, the same way Riebeck was an archaeologist; but in comparison, they were just more... perhaps indecisive was the word.
And on top of this... After they had gradually seen their best friend dissolve piece by piece, replaced with a pale copy stuck in time, spending time with this fake Firn was just about the *last* thing they wanted to do.
But... What were they even talking about? This *was* Firn. Just like this was the real Hornfels, and everyone was the same. It was precisely the problem, that everyone was the exact same as they had been hours ago and *forever* ago, but... It was still *them*. They were still real.
They were still real, and this very real Firn was offering them a new scenario that had a chance to *finally* break the pattern, if only once.
Hal tried their best to swallow their tears, not willing to let them fall a second time. Then, taking a short breath:

// "You know what? Fine. Let's go."
// "?" "W-wait, I wasn’t..."
// "But not the Attlerock. You told me everything there is to know about the ruins." "It's a signal locator, by the way."

"...Okay," they heaved in a pleading whisper. "But not the Attlerock. You've already told me all there is to see on the Attlerock."
(Firn is noticeably hesitant, without showing why. The reason is because they did not expect Hal to actually take up the offer, and the fact that they do makes them question whether Hal may be forgetting, or no longer caring, about the dangers of space.)

"Well— Then it's settled. We'll think of a destination on the way."
Firn turned to the path downwards and gestured them to follow; but then, after a few steps, they stopped and facepalmed. "*And* I forgot the launch codes."
"MDN," Hal retorted with a shrug, not stopping.
"...*Right*," they nodded, "bet you saw them on Hornfels' desk. Multiple times." <i>Allegedly</i> went unsaid a fraction of a second before the word could reach their mouth.

(For later at some point:) "So," Firn asked jokingly, "where to, captain?"
"Giant's..." The word had escaped their lips before they had taken the time to think; but they immediately fell silent. Looking down and pondering again... they eventually shook their head slightly and corrected themself: "Ash Twin."
Firn gave a noncommittal hum. "Anything you'd like to see there?"
As far as they were aware, this was the only planet where they would not encounter a single living being, Hearthian or otherwise. Also, to their knowledge, the only planet in which nothing dangerous was going to take place, since the sand was draining out of it, rather than raining down on it.
"Not really. Just a lot of quiet and *nothing*, I guess. Not that I'll be stepping out of the ship at all anyway."
"You can take my suit if you'd like to go on a walk," Firn shrugged. "Ship can feel a bit claustrophobic."
Hal huffed weakly, shaking their head. "No thanks. If you ask me, being stuck in that thing and having your only source of air fed to you by a tube feels even *more* claustrophobic."
"Heh. Fair enough."

(They go to the ship, and while Hal is taking a nervous look around, they eventually are startled when they hear Firn mumble breathlessly:)
"What in the– oh stars above..."
Hal perked up their head, and before they could say anything, their lungs were robbed of all air by a tight embrace.
"[Insert swearing]. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
Hal blinked repeatedly, refusing to process that *Firn*, of all Hearthians in the whole crater, would be the one to give them a *hug*.
"You..." They almost did not ask. Somehow, they feared asking would jinx it. "...You believe me now?"
"You'd mentioned the ship logs while you were ranting," Firn mumbled shamefully. "I took a look. You were right. I'm sorry."
Hal found themself hugging back.
"How many loops has it been?"
Five. Objectively not that much. And yet, already too much for their sanity to fully give in and for the observatory to become the darkest of prisons.
Firn seemed to have taken their silence for a heavy answer with, likely, much darker implications than Hal had intended. "*Geez*, pal. And you never thought of just, like, walking *out* and doing literally anything else?"
"I'm not the one with the ship," their shoulders simply shrugged, averting their gaze.
Firn frowned. "Well. Guess what, you have one now. And you'll have one every loop you want one."
"How would that even work? You're gonna..."
"Forget everything? We'll– we'll figure something out. Just let me process this whole– thing." They closed their eyes tight, took a deep breath, shook their head. "Just bear with me for like– just drag me here as fast as you can, show me the computer, and the ship is yours. Got it?"
()
"Hal, do you even... Do you know why your memories and the ship log don't get wiped out?"
"And Gabbro too," they corrected. "I think– We investigated a bit in some previous loops. It must be because of the Nomai statue." When Firn sent them a silent nod asking for clarifications, they obliged with a sigh: "The statue exhibit in the museum. On the first loop, it just... opened its eyes and messed with my head somehow. Gabbro had another statue do the same thing on Giant's Deep."
Firn's eyes slowly widened. "...and the ship's computer was made out of the part of the museum statue that got chipped by accident," they realized.
()
["Hal. Are there any other statues elsewhere?"] <— nope, Firn ponders this but doesn’t ask it out loud, thinking they don't want to bother Hal with too much thinking.


[...]
“…Five.”
Firn's head perked up, along with a hum of confusion.
“Five loops,” Hal admitted sheepishly. “Maybe six if we count the one where– never mind. This is… This is just the fifth time I’ve heard you do that whole ‘I’m just here for the launch codes’ thing.”
There was a second of stillness; then, Firn brought a hand to their chest and exhaled in immense relief.
“*Geysers*, Hal, I thought you’d been stuck for years or something.”
“I– Sorry, I didn’t…” They sighed, laughing sadly. “It’s just… so pathetic. I couldn’t even make it to the double digits before losing it.”
Firn sputtered in disbelief, shaking their head vehemently. “Hal, there shouldn’t even *be* a question of double digits. If anything, I’m *relieved* you got to let me know so soon.” Hal did not mention out loud that, technically, letting them know had never been the problem in the previous loops. “Like– *all* of those five times you’ve been in the ground control room with Hornfels, had to first tell *them* about the loop, and then you had to deal with *me* waltzing in asking for the launch codes–?”
“–and then leaving for the Attlerock, until about ten minutes later when you radio Hornfels or me and ask why your ship log has notes from the future.”
“Right,” Firn nodded severely. “Hal, that would have driven anyone *insane* in no time. And if it weren’t for me, you would have just– *stayed* there for even longer? Stars, I wouldn’t have expected that much patience from a <i>pine tree</i>.”
Hal strangled a few sputtering sounds before. “What else am I supposed to do? Steal your ship?”
“I mean, that’s an option if you have infinite time to practice and no lasting consequences on getting any injuries from it,” their friend shrugged.
“T-t-that would take me <i>ages</i> and I am <i>not</i> ready to find out other ways to <i>die</i>, Firn!” they cried out. “The supernova is bad enough!”
Firn paused, ears dropping alongside their assertiveness.
“Does it hurt?” they asked. “To die?”
Hal sent them a dark look. “You <i>know</i> I hate it when you pretend to be dumb just to encourage me to snark back at you. I don’t need your patronizing.”





[Once on Ash Twin, Firn offers Hal to have some quick time alone, and they use that time to start writing the first ship log entry which is specifically dedicated to talking to themself. They also suggest their future self try to pair with their own statue, saying they didn’t offer Hal to do it this time because they wanted Hal to just take a break.]
[......]

[]
Firn seemed to be typing furiously on their computer. In complete contrast, to the intent behind it, either the sound or Hal’s already present fatigue ended up lulling them to sleep.







Also during this loop, Firn actually got the scout out and took a photo of both them and Hal on Ash Twin, then sent it to the ship log's files, making it appear first, before even the message.
They also did it """accidentally""" while they were inside the ship, showing off their stuff to Hal and talking about the scout.
A flash of light suddenly blinded all four of their eyes, and they recoiled in surprise.
"Ow– Oh wow, that flash is *potent*." Firn turned to them with a sheepish smile. "Sorry, clumsy me. Those buttons sure are sensitive, huh?"



"ok so I'm not gonna remember the time loops. What is the fastest possible way to prove to my future self that Hal is not insane? Guess I could write tons of stuff in the ship log, and I've already done that, but I need to find a TL;DR version in case time limit is too tight. Hmmmmm..."
"This loop I managed to convince Hal to take a break and follow me in my ship into space. If I can prove that this happened..."
"Hey Hal, wanna check out the cool equipment in my ship? That's the Little Scout, it's super useful!"
*big flash of light*
"Ow- wow that flash is *potent*. Whoops, sorry for that. Those buttons are more sensitive than I thought, haha..."
—
Next loop, first thing Hal and amnesiac player see upon turning on the ship log is a selfie with a non-Timber Hearth planet in the background where Hal looks goofy AF
"So hey future me! Guess you’re wondering how I (aka you) managed to get Hal in space before you even had your first launch, right? >:D"






(They see the supernova going, and Firn tenses up, shivering.)
"Hal?"
They turned around with a confused hum, followed Firn's pointing finger, and saw that something bright was... folding in on itself?
It took them a blink to realize that this was the sun. For an instant, they found themself mesmerized, still and speechless.
It always was the village's night time, when it would start. And even if it hadn’t been, Hal had always been indoors, when it would happen.
"It's... it's going to be alright," they mumbled. "It only hurts for a second."
Hal was about to walk away, but a hand grabbed their arm and squeezed strongly.
Firn's pained expression hurt to look at. "So... That's it, right? See– see you next loop, I... guess? That's how it works?"
Next loop. Only then did Hal remember, again, what this truly meant; what was about to happen.
Eyes widening, they took a step back. "No..." Not again. *Not again.* "You can't... Please don't do this..." They stared at the sun, filled with fear, grief, anger, talking to it as if these desperate prayers could somehow be heard.
Sensing both their friend's distress and the general urgency of the situation, Firn chose to give their last moments of awareness as much meaning as they possibly could.
"Hal, listen to me," they pleaded with insistence. "Next time, don't bother with Hornfels. This morning I roasted a mallow or two with Slate– if you're fast enough, maybe you can catch me before I leave. Give me the launch codes yourself. Show me the ship log as fast as you can."
Hal was shaking, incapable of looking them in the eye. They were about...
"I don’t want to lose you," their lips shaped, without any air to turn those motions into words.
The sun, now only a small white sphere of condensed light, burst with pure immaculate plasma.
"Hal, you *won’t*, I promise. Please just bear with me for *one* more minute. Only that, no more."
They may have been grabbing their shoulders with all their might, but Hal only had eyes and ears for the end of their world. Firn's words were heard, but hardly listened to, eventually becoming a blur of panicked wishes which Hal was unsure they would have the strength to grant.
"—I got an idea, there's no time to explain but I wrote it down—"
Gabbro had described the supernova once or twice in the past loops. Poet as they were, though, no Hearthian words could ever be enough to express this raw display of power.
"—Hal, *please*, promise me you'll do it, I swear you won't regret it—"
For as devastating as the supernova was, as painful as it was about to be... This sight was beautiful. Dreadful, horrifying, cruel, uncaring, abhorrently *beautiful*.
Firn squeezed their shoulders, begging insistently. Hal's fingers twitched.
"I promise," they said, even though they were unsure which part of their soon-to-be dead best friend they had just sworn an oath to.
Giving one last encouraging pressure against their arm, Firn decided to hold them tight under one last embrace. They only had time for one last sentence; and they used it when their eyes widened in sudden recollection. "...Wait. The ship log, I'm sorry—"
The supernova's roar took their words, then their life. Somewhere in the land of three hours and forty minutes ago, Hal found their mind filled with memories of events they had never lived, of a promise to upkeep, and of a question powered with dread.

<!-- @SFOLD LOOP 7 — Firn attempts a slingshot and kills Hal. -->
<div id=loop7></div>
<div class=chp><h1>Loop 7</h1><hr>

<!--





Start of loop 7:
Firn: "Hal! Hey, what brings you here? Didn’t trust me to see you at the observatory?"
Hal's lips trembled. "F– Firn, look. There's, uh..."
"I'll be *fine* in space, Hal."
"No, you don’t understand, there's something in your ship..."
"If even so much as a *cricket* had made it in there, you know Slate would have wrestled it out of the ship in no time."
"*It's not a cricket!*"
Firn startled, eyes wide. "Whoa– uh. Okay, serious talk, you good? You had a nightmare, or...?"
"Oh I *wish* it could be one," and oh stars, their voice cracked and water was getting caught in the corner of their lower eyes.
()
"Just– j-just *please*, *listen*, for once! We have to get in your ship!"
"First off, I need the launch codes for that–"
"I have them," Hal cut in with a glare,
"–and second, what do you mean, 'we'? This is my first *solo* launch, and since when have you even *wanted* to go to space?"
(Hal starts breaking down.)
"Please, it's– it's *important*. Your computer, there's – you said you’d have to look at your computer."
"That's a brand new ship, there's not gonna be anything in it," Slate cut in with a raise of an eyebrow.
"Yeah, it *shouldn't*! But it *does*!"
Slate and Firn exchanged a confused, worried look.
"Okay, that’s just impossible, but even *if* you were right, how would you know?"
"Why don’t you just *get up there* and find out!? I just—" (Hal lets out a scream, muffled by nothing but their own hands burying their whole face.)
"Oookay, okay," Firn *finally* conceded, "we’re going! Geez, what’s gotten into you today?"
Slate stood up from their log, glaring warily. "Yeah, and *I’m* taking a look to make sure neither of you two has messed with the ship while I wasn’t looking."






"Firn, wait! " "I have– Hornfels gave me the launch codes, you have the clear for launch." A lie, but technically Hornfels would have given both about an hour later anyway. "Mind– mind if I join?"
Firn blinked in surprise, before furrowing their eyebrows in a mixture between amusement, confusion, and the tiniest bit of annoyance. "I thought this was my first solo launch?"
"I'm not a pilot, I don’t count," Hal shrugged, trying to appear nonchalant.
They still did not seem any more convinced. "Since when did you even *want* to go to space? Wasn’t the whole point of building the translator so you wouldn’t have to go to the ruins yourself?" Well, that and the fact that the translator was still much faster than Hal's advanced but not yet fluent reading comprehension of the Nomai language, but still.
Also, going to space was indeed the part Hal was looking forward the least. "I, uh... changed my mind?" Not really, it just was that they would rather deal with zero-G and the horrors of the cosmos than spend one more second with Hornfels. And also, they had a promise to keep.
Firn crossed their arms. "I don’t know what this is about, but... What, did Marl rope you into some kind of prank?"
"Wha– No!" Past loop Firn had made it sound so easy. They had not signed for this. "Look, just– There's... something in your ship that you gotta see–"
Firn's blasé look became even more insistent, accompanying their eyes with an unamused nod. "Yeah, I bet. Something Marl planted there during the night?"
Hal sighed. "Just– just... come along. Please."
(What convinces Firn first each loop is the fact that the orbital probe cannon fires, something which nobody could have possibly orchestrated or predicted.)
The next time Hal took a look at Firn, they
"Okay, I think we should go meet up with Gabbro," they asserted with confidence, despite a slightly wavering voice. When Hal merely stared at them, they blinked in return and frowned, lips slightly trembling. "What?"
Hal blinked again. "That’s… That’s it? I mean, you’re just gonna…"
"Time loop, supernova, Nomai statues, Gabbro's in it too, something on Giant's Deep that might be worth looking into," they shrugged heavily. "Did I forget anything?"
At a loss for words, Hal merely turned their eyes to the computer screen, then to Firn, back and forth. Finally, they managed to ask: "...What on Hearth did you write in that ship log that could convince you so quickly?"
"A few notes about the thing orbiting Giant's Deep that I saw exploding first thing this morning, and how it's literally impossible for my ship log to have any kind of info about that whatsoever unless, somehow, it already happened before. Which is impossible because the notes mention that the cannon was destroyed upon firing, and the cannon I saw this morning also was destroyed when it fired." "Also, the ship logs have dates, and I don’t think you or Marl would know how to hack it in order to make it look like those notes were written in the future."
After hearing this, Hal found that they needed just a few instants to merely process what had been said. Their eyes met with a small potted plant, and suddenly its tiny hatchling leaves felt like the most fascinating sight in the galaxy.
Past loop Firn had been adamant that the ship log alone would be enough to convince their future selves, but Hal had not dared imagine that it could possibly be so effective.
"You good, buddy?"
Hal blinked again. "Yeah– yeah. I... I'm just not– I'm no longer used to you being... No, I mean... Last loop you told me that you'd be easy to convince if I could show you the ship log, but I– I underestimated how effective that would be. Wow."
"Good thing that random cannon somewhere in space happened to be caught in the loop and explode right under my eyes, right?"
"...Yeah."
Had Hal not been already too happy and relieved to finally have the universe do them a favor for once, they almost might have pondered about just how lucky this was, and whether it truly could have been nothing but pure coincidence.
Hal was not the type of Hearthian to jinx their own good fortune, however, and therefore did not give this thought more than a single distracted second.
"So, ready for launch?" Firn asked from over their shoulder. Hal was startled again, only now noticing that their pilot friend was already seated and buckled up, even in their suit, and was merely waiting for their signal. "Giant's Deep, right? I was thinking, and... Unless the ship log forgot to mention it, there's something I'm curious about that we didn’t try yet."
"Like what?"
"The statues are what lets you, the ship, and Gabbro remember, right?"
"That's the current hypothesis, yeah."
"And your statue came from the same place as where Gabbro got theirs. There's gotta be more than just those two, right?"
"Are you saying...?"
A serious nod. "I want in. I'm not leaving you alone in this mess."

When they all see the photo:
Firn’s jaw dropped. Slate would be howling with laughter if they weren’t so busy being shocked at the sight and trying to make any sort of sense of it. Hal’s grip on the ledge of the desk tightened, suddenly remembering the previous loop’s seemingly inconsequential <i>incident</i> with the little scout.
“You— That was on <i>purpose!?</i>” they strangled, bringing a shaking hand to their forehead. “Why you– y-you <i>voidbrain</i>…”
Firn could not tell whether Hal was laughing or crying.
()
"Did you <i>have</i> to do it like this?"
"If… uh… I-I think that might have been part of the plan? Maybe?"
"Yeah, pranking me across space and time. Of course you would come up with something like that."
"And– and I think that’s the <i>point</i>–" "You wouldn’t have made that face if you were in on it. This isn’t <i>just</i> a prank, Hal. It's proof that *you* didn’t set it up. It's proof that– that <i>I</i> set it up, somehow."
"Because of the time loop," Hal mumbled.
Firn nodded heavily. "Because of the time loop."
Hal buried their head in one hand, rubbing their forehead.
"…You are the worst. You are the *absolute* worst."
"Well, uh– as long as it works?"
Firn swore they heard Hal mumble under their breath something about this still being better than the observatory. Whatever that meant.



Slate also gets up in the ship.

“Hal. It took you forty minutes to convince me that there was a time loop to begin with, and Slate got involved, which means we both slowed you down way more than we can afford to, and– way more than you’d feel comfortable in the long run, I bet. Sure can’t… I can’t imagine you going through that again even just a <i>second</i> time, given how awful the first was on its own.” “I don’t care if it’s just your [xth] time around and if you might find a more optimized way down the line—my point is that you shouldn’t <i>have</i> to. I’m not making you go through that. Even if the loops—<i>especially</i> if the loops just keep going on and on.”
“T-there won’t, I’m sure we’ll solve the problem soon—”
“Hal, either you’re lying about us having three sunrises to stop the <i>sun</i> from blowing up, or you’re lying right now about how easy it’s gonna be.”
[]
“My mind isn’t gonna change until <i>maybe</i> I see the sun explode and I start having second thoughts, but that means that if I’m not allowed to remember, that’s not gonna change in the next loops either. I want in, and that’s final.”

“Also, I don’t think you have time <i>or</i> the nerves to afford getting Slate involved in this every time,” Firn said gravely. Pursing their lips, they glanced sheepishly at the Hearthian in question and quickly added: “No offense, Slate.”
The founder rolled their eyes. “None taken. I think. I get where you’re coming from.”
“It’s just that dealing with <i>me</i> is bad enough,” they grunted with resentment.

-->
<wip>Right after the photo, Firn finds an audio recording:</wip>
<p class=vs>If the photo on its own had somehow not been enough and Firn had ever needed any more convincing by this point, what came next was the nail in the coffin for their last traces of doubt.</p>
<p>As soon as the recording started and the crackling of what had to be the phantom sound of the static caused by a button being released ended, the young cadet was met with the sound of <i>their own voice</i>.</p>
<p class=radio><i>“‘Sup, future me? …Or ‘next loop’ me, I guess. Or however that works. Whatever, I’ll just go with ‘future me’, it’s not like it’ll matter for long.”</i></p>
<p class=vs>Hal staggered back, grabbing a wall in order to keep their balance. The other two Hearthians froze into stupor, jaws somehow dropping even lower than the first time.</p>
<p>The recording did not wait for any of them to recover.</p>
<p class=radio><i>“So, I bet you have a lot of questions right now. Sure had a ton of those when it was </i>my<i> turn to see notes I couldn’t possibly have written myself, and photos of space right inside my computer with a whole day’s worth of exploring.”</i></p>
<p class=vs>Firn found themself nodding, or perhaps just trembling their head up and down a little bit.</p><p>Slate had to catch Hal in order for them not to collapse to the floor.</p>
<p class=radio><i>“If I set things right and the photo was the first thing to show up when you turned the screen on– Yep, that’s you and Hal on Ash Twin. So now that I’ve got your attention, I hope you’ll spend a minute or two checking the rest… But, uh, if you’re listening right now, I guess it means you were doing just that, heh. There’s a quick rundown of everything you need to know in there, so go check that out <i>before</i> you ask Hal any questions, got it?”</i></p>
<p>Hal brought both hands to their mouth, trying not to scream, or wail, or make any sound. They could not dare disturb what had to be, if only from their perspective, the previous ghost of their best friend’s last words.</p>
<p><i class=radio>“Anyway,”</i> the recording continued, <i class=radio>“there’s no time to lose, so I’ll be signing off here. Good luck.”</i></p>
<p>“<i>No!</i>” Hal cried back, shaking themself off Slate’s grasp and scrambling to the screen as the air turned to static. “<span class=scaps>d</span>-don’t leave…”</p>
<p>The record ended. Tears rolled down their cheeks. Slate tentatively placed a shaking but supporting hand on their shoulder, not daring to look or move a single other muscle. Firn’s legs gave in as they kneeled down for a hug.</p>
<p>There was a sniff. “Right before the… before you…” Hal sobbed before burying their glassy eyes in their hands. “Y-you’d asked me to bring you here and show you the ship log. I-<span class=scaps>i</span> tried… I tried my best, but…”</p>
<p>Firn and Slate exchanged a heavy look in silence. Turning back to Hal, the younger one tightened their embrace, trying not to let the bubbling rage within them escape their chest. “I’m sorry I made it so hard for you.”</p>
<p>“They said they had a plan,” Hal stuttered weakly. Trembling, they raised their head and turned it to face that of their friend’s current iteration; and Firn realized that, for the very first time this morning, their eyes were looking <i>at</i> them, instead of <i>through</i> them. Hal gulped, now overcome by a wave of guilt, before they corrected their earlier sentence: “…<i>You</i> said you had a plan.”</p>
<p>Firn’s ears flattened as they stood back in shocked silence, incapable of finding the strength to remind them that even if that were true, they no longer had any idea of it. Their lips pinched into a thin line as they took a short, tense breath; but they instantly frowned with determination.</p>
<p>“I managed to leave a photo and a whole recording, I must have left notes about that plan <i>some</i>where for sure,” they assured. “And even if I haven’t– I got that plan figured out <i>during</i> the loop, with <i>less</i> information than we’re gonna get this time. I’m just gonna come up with it again.”</p>



<wip></wip>
<p>“Slate… You won’t tell anyone that Hal’s coming with me, right?”</p>
<p>The engineer closed their eyes and raised their hands, the corner of their lips trying to tilt up teasingly. “As long as this ship launches and the cockpit stays attached during liftoff, I’m not gonna complain.”</p>
<p>Hal’s ears dropped and they gulped, stuttering a tiny <i>“W-what do you mean, ‘stay attached’?”</i>. Firn frowned and glared at the founder, grunting that <i>maybe</i> they could have kept that kind of comment to themself.</p>
<p>Slate’s joking attempt at a smile faltered completely as they bent down and opened the hatch, ready to jump out and let them go. They still tried to show comfort when they replied: “Relax, we got proof you managed a whole liftoff and landing on your own and that it went <i>just fine</i>,” they shrugged lightly. “Just watch out for the thrust-to-weight ratio, this beauty wasn’t designed with passengers in mind. But– well, again, you two took off once already, so I reckon that won’t be an issue this time either.”</p>
<wip>(Slate jumps out and rides the elevator down)</wip>
<p class=vs>Wait. Wouldn’t the other one need a spacesuit, at least? Did Firn have a spare one?</p>
<p>…Meh. They would manage. They’d be surprised if Hal planned to actually step out of that ship while in space, anyway.</p>
<hr>
<!--
— Ship log notes:
<li>Apparently from the past loops, we got to discover that there’s a whole workshop on Giant’s Deep. There’s <i>bound</i> to be tons of other statues there!</li>
<li>Maybe we could even pull a few others in it too, like Hornfels. It’d be super useful to have ground control support, and Hal wouldn’t even <i>have</i> to go to space to avoid them anymore.

Slate slowly shook their head. “This is positively insane.”
Firn eyed them, deadpan but trembling in their voice. “You see any other way around explaining this?”
The engineer returned their blasé look with a huff, opening their mouth with a retort ready to accuse the newest astronaut of having orchestrated it all. However, deciding to take just one last second to consider every step which would have been required in order for such orchestration to have been even remotely achievable in the first place, they remained silent; and then, judging that a great majority of these steps were at best unlikely to occur, at worst entirely unfeasible short of a village-scale conspiracy built from the ground up and carefully maintained for weeks with no concrete objective other than to bamboozle them specifically for a grand total of perhaps five minutes at most, they closed their mouth in frustration.
“My previous statement and your answer being ‘no’ are not mutually exclusive,” they begrudgingly grouched instead.









"Can’t you tell how far your ship is from your current location?"
Gabbro's head rose up and back, staring as if Firn had grown a second head. "Can you?"
"Well, *yeah*. As soon as I leave my ship I get a marker in the corner of my visor."
There was a huff, and Gabbro turned around, walking away. "I see Slate had fun with those shiny new features since they were finished with mine. Lucky you."




Loop where Firn tries to pair with a statue. Firn is surprised that Gabbro is actively helping.
"Well, they're in space without any kind of training, so they need a responsible adult to make sure they don't die too often."
Hal simply stared in disbelief.
"Fine, Hal gets the adult points. But they still need a competent astronaut," they soon corrected.
Hal's brows furrowed deeper. "Who managed to lose their ship before the loops started."
"Fine, fine," they conceded with arms raised in defeat. "But at least I have the first aid training and flight experience."




Seeing something ahead, Firn gave a short gasp and trotted for a few dozen meters.
"There’s a statue here!" they exclaimed; but their enthusiasm soon died down the moment they got close enough to have a better look. "...But its eyes are already opened."
"Yeah, that one’s mine," Gabbro mumbled, refraining from adding that they already had seen it before, just that they… did not remember doing so.
Gabbro not having said it did not mean that Firn did not have the ability to make that guess on their own. "Ha… Right. I should’ve assumed yours would be the first we’d find. We’re not even inside the workshop yet."
(Hal feels conflicted about how antsy and restless Firn looks, with their hands shaking with some kind of trepidation that comes neither from fear nor from joy, but solely from the visceral rejection of the unknown, and the sheer drive to fish out knowledge and objectives out of the obscurity.)



Loop where Firn tries to pair with a statue: they die early.
Fighting against a sleep they felt they would not wake up from, they tried to align at least one or both pair of eyes with those of their best friend, hovering over them. Between two coughs, they painfully managed to whimper: "Please don't... forget me."
Hal shook their head vehemently, still trying to stop their bleeding. "You'll be alright," they retorted shakily, "time will go back and you'll be all good again, hang on—"



“Hey, uh. I was thinking.” “If the statues are responsible for keeping you aware of the loops, then… think we could try finding a third one for me?”
Hal blinked hard, staring at them in shock. “You. You <i>sure</i> about this, Firn? That’s… Being in a time loop is <i>not</i> fun. Dying in a supernova once already sucks, dying more than once is even worse.”
Firn returned their look, staring with all four eyes with purpose and determination. Their mind was already set. “I’m the one with the translator. My ship’s the only thing that can hold any tangible notes about anything. If I’m gonna be your pilot, then I’ll just be a pain in your back if I don’t remember.”
“We can manage that—” This was a lie.
“And I know you’re just saying this because you care,” they retorted while shaking their head. “And <i>I</i> care about you too. I don’t want to be holding you back like this every time, I’m sure in the long run that’d be even worse than if you just stole the ship and ignored me completely.” Before they could get a single word in, Firn was already shaking their head again, with even more resolve. “That’s why I want in, Hal. I hate knowing you’re in it alone.”
“I’m not <i>alone</i>, there’s still Gabbro, remember?” they shrugged while arching their eyebrows in a sorry and somewhat offended way.
Firn dropped their head to the side and gave them A Look. Hal’s shoulders slumped and they sighed heavily.
“It’s… It’s really not that bad, I swear. They’ve been helping. I don’t know whether they care about stopping the loops, but they care about <i>us</i>, they really do. They’ve been helping when it mattered.”
“Yeah, and I don’t think they have the same threshold on <i>when</i> things matter,” Firn whispered back. “No offense to them, really. I haven’t seen them in the previous loops. But if they’ve been like how they are in this one, then… It looks like they just gave up on trying. Like they think there’s no way to solve this. Like the only reason they’re doing anything is because <i>you</i> are trying to solve it and they don’t want you losing your mind over it.” They sighed. “It just… It still feels lonely. You <i>sound</i> lonely, Hal. And I can’t take it.”

They go to Giant’s Deep, find a couple finished ones. Taking a gulp, fists clenched, ears twitching from inside their helmet, Firn took a stiff breath, then stepped forward. Slowly, but then with purpose, they walked closer and closer. Then, everyone waited. One second, two.
Nothing happened.
Firn clenched their teeth, gripped one of the closest statue’s top horns with fierce and desperate hands, bent down to a knee to stare at its closed eyes with as much intent as they could; with more determination than the universe itself. When they still did not see anything happening, ignoring their sense of self-preservation by hardly checking if trees were nearby, they removed their helmet just so the visor would not be in the way, and so they could inch ever closer to the point that their forehead was practically clashing against the stone fur.
The eyes did not open.
“Maybe… Maybe this one’s just broken,” Firn said with a hollow voice, far too high-pitched for them. “I’ll try with another one.”
Hal’s lips trembled. “Firn…”
“I’m not leaving you two alone in this,” they cut sharply, voice back to its normal pitch, but this time filled with venom. “I’m not abandoning you like this. I can’t. I <i>won’t</i>.”
Pacing across the room, they stopped by one statue, then the next, then the one after that, each time getting more frantic and impatient. When their fist started raising into the air, ready to hit, two fellow Hearthians were needed in order to stop them from puncturing their glove by having them clash against the sharp edges of petrified fur made of sharp edges, and pull them back against their wishes.
“Firn, please,” Hal pleaded with a sob. “Stop. This isn’t… This isn’t working.”
Gabbro put a comforting, but so distant and foreign hand on their shoulder.
“Deep breaths, buddy,” they advised with a calm sigh, giving an example by following their own words. “You can’t do anything about it. It’s not your fault.”
Firn’s hands covered their watering face, no longer capable of holding their sobs.
“I’m sorry. This is unfair. This is <i>so</i> unfair.”
The grip on their shoulder shook just ever so slightly, insistant. “Firn. Buddy. <i>Not your fault.</i> Just let it go.”
[...]
“The statues activated on the same loop for the both of us,” Gabbro explained slowly. “Maybe that was the only loop where it could have happened.”












Stone, and stone, and more stone. How could a single living soul in the universe expect them to tinker with Nomai technology when there was not a trace of machinery anywhere? How did the Nomai do any of what they had accomplished?

It is only later, thanks to Solanum, that they obtain some information on how to use a Nomai staff and tinker with Nomaian technology, and therefore learn that it is about imbuing stone with information using those staves; meaning that save for the Ash Twin project, there are no tangible cables to tinker with. This is why even after being chipped and repurposed, the ship log's data still resonates with Hal’s mask and is still stored equally. Hal is the only one who manages to get good at using a Nomai staff, with Gabbro being barely able to, but hardly due to their inability to understand the language.
























Loop after that:
“Hey, uh. I was thinking.” “If the statues are responsible for keeping you aware of the loops, then…”
Hal’s grip on the backrest tightened.
“We tried,” they murmured. “Didn’t work.”
Firn fell silent. Their shoulders stayed squared for a few seconds; then slowly slumped.
“Oh.” Their hands let go of the levers and fell on their lap. “Can I… have a minute?”
“Huh? Uh, sure,” Hal blinked. “It’s… yeah, you took it pretty hard last time too.”
Firn hastily unbuckled and stood up from their seat, walking away from the cockpit. Hal did not turn to look, instead digging their nails into the backrest again, for just a few seconds… before taking a deep sigh, and relaxing them. They needed to move on, Gabbro was still waiting; but also, so what if they were going to arrive late? Gabbro was, well, Gabbro. Even if Firn was about to forget all about it in just a few hours, they were still their best friend.
Hal had also voluntarily refrained from saying that they had died soon after the statue non-pairing fiasco. One heavy non-reveal was enough as it was.
[...]
Hal looked at them with sorrow and gulped guiltily. “You good?”
Firn sat down, seized the levers, then took a deep breath. “…Okay. <span class=smol>Okay.</span> I’m good. Let’s go.”

<wip>(Right after Slate and Firn gag at the sight of a second photo, this time that of Firn’s broken ship on a beach of Giant’s Deep and a dead Hal impaled through the glass.)</wip>
<p>“<i>GEYS</i>—!” Slate gagged before they could finish even that single word.</p>
<p>Mouth agape and trembling, Firn stared and, the same way their best friend evidently had in a different time, it appeared that air was forced out of painfully punctured lungs, by the forces of nature and Hearthian culture alike.</p>
<p>“Hatchling,” the engineer wheezed in panic, “you are <i>messed up</i>.”</p>
<p>They did not respond, whether to deny or confirm. They soon knew exactly why this photo had been taken and saved for their next loop self to find: two short lines of text sat right beneath the morbid surprise.</p>
<p><i>No stunts.</i></p>
<p><i>We <b>promised</b>.</i></p>
<p>The same way showing something physically impossible had been the quickest method to convince them that the laws of physics had indeed been repeatedly broken, Firn knew that showing their own worst nightmare, with <i>tangible proof</i> that it had once been real, was the most efficient way to get the point across.</p>
<p>And the most effective way to make them realize, perhaps for the first time in their whole life, that their actions had consequences.</p>
<p>That their actions could have consequences on others.</p>
<p>“S– Sorry.” Deep breath. “I. I don’t think anyone else was supposed to see this.”</p>
<p>“Like that’s supposed to make me feel better,” Slate sputtered with concern.</p>

Firn *trying* to get paired on Loop 8:
"*Let me at it!*" they screamed, the frequency of their voice dangerously rising, radio saturating with anger. "You piece of *fermented dirt*– LOOK AT ME!" "*Let me go*! If it won't open its eyes, I'll just— I-I'll tear it apart myself and MAKE it!"
Gossan closed their eyes in pain. "Firn... Hornfels had been trying to get Hal's to do that for weeks, without any success."
"Yeah, well– I'm sure Hornfels didn't try it like *THIS*!" (Tries to throw a kick at the statue, only manages to get themself hurt.)
Gabbro: "Buddy... *Firn*. Listen to me. It's... It's not gonna happen."
"*Screw you, Gabbro!*" "We wouldn't *be* here if you hadn't spent all these loops leaving Hal *completely alone* like you've done!" "Ha– ha, we– We wouldn't even be here if you had never *found* that statue to begin with!"
(Gossan took a step forward in warning. "Firn. Don’t.")
(Their eyes full of bubbling rage met the calming waters of their mentor's. Those stern eyes, those three eyes of which they *knew* what had happened to the fourth, knew where fell the responsibility for its absence.
Anger turned to despair, and Firn fell to their knees.)
"Please..." they sobbed. "You can't make me forget again. *You can't!* Not *again!*" "Why did you have to pick them, huh!? Why didn't you pick someone who'd have a *chance* at figuring out what's wrong!"
(Full on sobbing, possibly kicking into a nomai skeleton in rage)
"Hal has been fascinated with your culture and secrets– they've spent *years* off their life trying to figure you out, they had nothing but *respect* for you! And *this* is how you *repay* them!? You *monsters!*"

<!--
Gabbro, already standing and watching them land with their gear ready, gave a solemn nod.
Firn making a scrapbook of sorts in their ship log, taking various photos of Hal in space:

"Hal finally discovers the joys of zero-g!"
"oh shit they noticed shit shIT SHIT"








VISION-POWERED NOMAI TECH DOES NOT WORK WITH NON-PAIRED HEARTHIANS.
The Nomai operated that technology with their third eye, an eye which Hearthians do not have. Hearthians paired with statues become able to because of their link to their statues' equivalent. Describe a feeling like having their inner sight being tugged away, similarly to the pull of the statue once had, but much more fleeting and inconsequential.

(Hal activates the sphere, seeing it light up.) They gasped in swift shock, bracing themself for what almost felt like another *'spiritual experience with a rock'* (albeit, this time, not shaped like a face); yet, aside from this first fleeting instant of intrusiveness with the feeling of something tugging away at their inner sight and stealing the attention given to it before converting it into a bright purplish light, nothing fundamentally consequential seemed to happen.
Firn placed a hand on their shoulder. "Hal, you good? It looks like you saw— whoa!"
By the time their sentence was almost finished, Hal had moved their eyes to meet Firn's, on their way to explaining what had just occurred, and to pondering why they had not noticed the sphere's obvious change in color and brightness. However, Firn's yelp had interrupted them before they could proceed with either topic.
"What in Youngbark's geysers– Did you *see* that!?" Firn cried out. "It just moved on its own!"
Hal turned back to the wall, and saw that the sphere had, first off, lost their color, and second, been left somewhere in the middle of the rails, still having barely some momentum left— and never mind that, the exact second Hal's attention was once again focused on it, the sphere lit up again, tugging away from Hal's mind with that same intrusive feeling *again*, and as they staggered back without daring to look away this time, they distinctly saw that the sphere's movements were reflecting those of their own eyes, even through the thickness of their visor.
They were staring at the ball; and somehow, the ball was staring back.
"It... looks like it can be operated by looking at it," they mused with another gasp, this time filled with awe. "That would align with some technical texts Riebeck once brought..."
"*Wow*," Firn exclaimed in an impressed mutter. "We've *never* seen any of those things in action on Timber Hearth, that's for sure. Slate would've added that to every ship they could if we'd ever found a working one." Soon, however, their expression turned to confusion and doubt, as theirs shoulders tensed at once.
Oblivious to this last fact, Hal nodded, both nervous and giddy at the novelty which was yet, somehow, distantly familiar in a rather uncomfortable way. "Well, maybe the ones on Timber Hearth are broken? But evidently this one still works," they shrugged with a smile, caring not to let their eyes wander too close to that specific spot on the mechanism. Turning to their best friend, they took a step back and raised an amused, inviting hand: "Wanna give it a try?"
Firn paused. It was difficult to know what they were looking at or looking like, due to the visor obscuring their face; but one observation which could be unanimously made, was the fact that the sphere remained unlit and motionless.
Hal blinked, briefly looking at the door only to startle as they saw the ball react to *their* observation instead, and to immediately force their eyes shut. They pursed their lips awkwardly. "You, uh, have to–"
"Hal, I *am* looking at it. I've been *staring* at that thing for the past two minutes while we were talking. I don’t think 'looking at it' is what triggers it, honestly."
"What? No, I swear that's..." Hal turned to the sphere– a single glance, a foreign tug and the feeling of seeing their status as an observer temporarily returned right back to them and mingled with that of the observed, and the sphere was glowing and moving.
"You've gotta be joking," Firn grunted while glaring at the mechanism. "Sure you haven't found a secret lever you're pulling when I'm not looking?"
"Firn," Hal sighed exasperatedly with a roll of their eyes, "you know I'm not *you*."
Both hatchlings startled when the sphere lit up on its own and was operated once again.
Then it dimmed and went still, and a third figure appeared between them. "Seems like it's a Firn issue," Gabbro stated calmly. "It really does follow my eyes."
Hal looked at their best friend with worry. "W-what are you talking about? What does that mean?"
"Beats me," Gabbro shrugged. "Maybe that's another statue thing."
If Hal's ears were not compressed by the tight space of their helmet, they would be flattened to the extent of touching the ground. "That's... not fair."
Firn's fists were shaking, but they remained silent for very, very long seconds.
"Guess you might as well try and see if the ones on Timber Hearth are *really* broken, then," they eventually spoke in an annoyed whisper. "...in another loop. Yay to me being locked out of *another* cool thing. Again."
"But why would being able to *open a door* be related to being stuck in a time loop? That's ridiculous," Hal frowned.
"*Convoluted*," Gabbro opted for correcting. "Who knows, maybe the Nomai were living in a time loop the whole time."
"...I'm not gonna try to pretend I can even remotely have a clue what that might have looked like and how much I'm pretty sure that makes zero sense," Firn sighed. "They disappeared *eventually*, after all, so time loop from eons ago or not, that didn't last."
(Hal keeps trying to figure it out as they move on, and eventually:)
Hal stopped, gasping. "The third eye."
Both astronauts stopped, turning around and staring in surprise. Firn piped up: "What?"
"Multiple texts seemed to imply that the Nomai's third eye was, well, *different* from the other two, somehow. What if it's because of that third eye that they could operate the vision mechanisms?"
Firn and Gabbro paused, exchanging a glance. Firn crossed their arms. "Nice theory, but I didn't see you or Gabbro with a new eye hole on your foreheads."
Hal remained silent, instead looking at Gabbro expectantly.
"You... you know what I'm talking about, right?" "The feeling of– of *being* observed? Like, constantly, ever since the loops started?"
Gabbro's stance shifted uncomfortably. They took a deep breath. Then, turning to Firn, they found the words to summarize the conclusion that both had just deduced: "We don't have Nomai eyes, no. But the *statues* have one. Maybe all three of them count, even, who knows." They pulled their eyes back to their companion in misfortune, then added: "Methinks we are observing things, and the statues are observing what *we* are observing. Which sort of makes it count like we're looking at things with a Nomai eye somewhere in our heads, or however that works."
Firn squinted. "You're saying you're being... spied on? Through your own eyes?"
"By a computer statue thingy," Gabbro nodded with a shrug. "Yep. *Something* is sending us memories of what we did every loop. Must mean they're being recorded somehow before that. Which must mean the recording's taking notes right now, probably."
(Silence.)
"I guess that explains why nobody ever figured out those mechanisms before," Hal whispered.










Firn sat down at their log, picking up their marshmallow stick and pretending to roast a delicacy that wasn’t there. “Okay, Hal. Ready?”
Hal stared at them from the other side of the clearing, standing upright and rigid like a stake. They nervously but purposefully shook their head. “Nuh-uh.”
“Too bad, ‘cause time’s ticking. You already wasted twelve seconds.”
Hal’s hands closed into shaking fists, lips trembling. “Don’t count the time, it’s stressing me out.”
“Sixteen,” they insisted with a sly grin.
“<i>Firn!</i>”
“<i>Seventeen.</i>”
“Urgh— F-<i>fine</i>, fine!” they shouted while throwing their hands in the air, before trotting in their direction and grabbing their arm, trying to pull up. “This is ridiculous.”
“It won’t be in two sunrises,” the cadet reminded coldly. “Use your momentum, don’t stop when you get to me. And be faster, you gotta watch out for Slate as well.”
Hal’s eyebrows twitched as they raised two pairs of trembling eyes to the Hearthian in question. The engineer swallowed the marshmallow they were greedily enjoying while watching the scene, then sent them an amused wave. “Don’t mind me, I’m leaving you on easy mode for this loop.”
Hal let yet another exasperated grunt resonate within their throat.
[...]
One of Hal’s attempts at pulling Firn up will get their legs tangled in their log and get them injured, and Hal will cry out.
Hal gasped, letting go instantly to instead bring both hands to their mouth and clutch their face in horror. “S-sorry! Sorry– o-oh geez, I’m so sorry, are you—”
Firn grumbled in pain. “Just continue.”
“W-what!?”
“Continue!” they repeated with more insistence. “It’s just a scratch!”
“B-but what if—”
“Time is <i>ticking</i>, Hal!”
Slate put their stick down and stood up. “Firn, I think that’s enough.”
“The time loop doesn’t <i>care</i> if that’s enough!” they roared. “Get back down. Hal, let’s do it again. From the beginning.”
Unmoving, the founder frowned, sending the two a worried glance. “Hal…”
“<i>I can’t!</i>” Hal screamed.
Slate’s lips pressed into a thin line.
“I-I can’t…”
Firn lowered their head to the ground, gritting their teeth. Their arms went to wrap their knees as they let their chin rest on top.
“I can’t have that happen to you again,” they whispered. “It’s— you’ve been through <i>this</i> like, what– five times by now?”
“T-they weren’t as bad as the ones in the observatory,” Hal assured with a nervous smile.
“I don’t <i>care</i> if they’re not as bad,” Firn grunted, “they’re still <i>bad!</i> And they’ll just get worse and <i>worse</i> the more loops you go through! And I’ll be the cause of it, and I can’t do <i>anything</i> about it!”
[...]
“Please. Please try it,” Firn whispered in a broken voice. “I don’t want to hurt you more than I already have.”







As soon as they both jumped down and landed on the beach, footsteps came to meet them. Gabbro.
“Time Buddy,” they greeted Hal. Then, turning to Firn, they gave another, more hesitant nod. “…Buddy.”
The ears of the buddy in question flicked nervously as they looked down and pressed their lips together.
“Sucks to be jostled around and confused, we know. Totally my bad for losing my ship,” they added with genuine intent, but abnormally quick and distant tone. The tone of rehearsal.
Hal rolled their eyes, confirming Firn’s suspicion. “Gabbro, no offense, but you’ve used this exact phrasing at <i>least</i> four times,” they exhaled. “Do you really have to?”
“Hey, still gotta be polite,” they shrugged. Turning to Firn, they added: “Don’t worry, it’s not that they don’t think you deserve an apology. It’s just that—”
“—that it sucks to hear your friends repeat the same thing over and over, so since <i>you</i> have the ability not to it hurts them to hear you repeat yourself,” Firn completed in a tense mumble.
The elder astronaut noticeably stepped back just a bit, and were their visor not so opaque, Firn could have seen that their exorbitant eyes just doubled in size. “Whoa, how did you…”
“Figured that out on the way here,” they shrugged heavily.
“Buddy. I don’t know how you do it, but you’re a lot more perceptive than I gave you credit for. I’ll keep that in mind for the next ones.”
Again, Firn’s only answer was a hesitant, somewhat trembling shrug. “I’ve, uh… got my ways. Can’t say it’s nearly as effective as I wish it could though.”
They frowned. “Ship log?”
Firn replied with a raised eyebrow, then a nod.
“Got to see how you use it on my first loop, and Hal told me it can remember somehow. Turns out Slate’s spoiling you with your fancy equipment really is [a godsend].”
“Yeah.” A pause. “Wish I’d thanked them for it while I had the chance. I feel like a jerk.”
“So do we for ruining your launch day,” Gabbro shrugged heavily.
Firn simply sent a short hum. Turning away and towards the pilot’s seat, they added with a tint of urgency and sorrow: “Come on, Hal’s waiting.”



Firn offers Hal to spend a few loops without them.
"You know, if you need space—like, <i>personal</i> space, not <i>space</i> space—I can…" "I can just write down for the next few me’s to not bother you."


The first time Hal and Firn make it into the Ash Twin Project, Hal has a moment of near panic attack upon realizing just how vulnerable seeing their memory in physical form (the masks) and seeing that one of them is broken makes them feel. Firn relates with that since their memory is pretty much also stored in physical form on the ship log.
Firn will want to try and see if they could possibly tinker with the masks/statue and force one to pair with them? Regardless of whether their attempt is successful or not, this would be pretty much the end of the line anyway, and after they found the sun station. So maybe you can afford to finally have them reunite in the end.

Ship Log:

• "That's... starting to be a lot of loops, huh. Won’t be long before one of the future me's will give up and not even start reading.
• "Oh geez. Past loops me left a lot of messages, didn’t they. I don’t think I'll have time to read them to catch up."
• "Oh geez. Past loops me left a lot of messages, didn’t they. I don’t think I'll have time to read them to catch up.
...Stars above I just glanced at last loop's entry and I just said the exact same thing word for word. How can I stop this!?
I can't afford to fall behind. For Hal and Gabbro, for me, for everyone.
They need the ship and the translator. They can’t have those if I can't *keep track* and pull my own weight.
Future me's, no matter what you do in the next loops, KEEP READING THESE NOTES. I'M WRITING THEM FOR A REASON."
• "[...] I, uh, hope I didn’t say that already, haha. Sorry if I did."
• "[...] ...I hope I didn’t say that already."
• "If I really leave a message every single loop, this is the 57th. That’s... that's a lot. Wow.
Say, you know, if one of these loops you just went in and scooped up the ship while I'm off to getting the codes from Hornfels, I won't mind. I mean, I *will* mind, obviously, I'll be super worried and confused, but. You get what I mean. You have this loop me's permission.
I was about to say "I hope I didn’t say that already," but given the amount of entries there's no way I never said *that* already."
• "Assuming I wrote a message like this every loop, this seems to be the 72th...? Geysers. By this point I wonder if you might as well be more efficient piloting the ship yourself.
I hope you're not getting too tired of hearing me saying the same things over and over. I wish I could avoid that."
• "There's no time to read what I said in the past loops. There's so many entries.
I don’t know if I ever took the time to do that back when there was a reasonable amount. I hope I did at least early on. Hopefully that would have helped for some time. I bet I'm just boring and predictable now.
I'm sorry. I'm making you waste so much time. I'm so sorry."
• (Repeat that last entry a few times in a row with little to no variation.)





“We don’t talk about loop [63].” (loop where Nomai probe hit Firn’s ship and they and Hal argued very badly due to Hal and Gabbro not having any evidence to prove they’re in a time loop, no ship to go anywhere, and no tools to do anything with because they were either destroyed by the probe or in Firn’s hands.)




“Knowing me, I’m sure I’d be insufferable without those ship logs,” Firn shrugged heavily. “It hurts to say, but. I wasn’t believing a single word you were saying until I saw those, and the only reason I played along until that point was because you said you had tangible evidence. No offense, it’s just… It’s just that this whole thing is too crazy to just… you know.”
“To be fair, I don’t think I’d believe you either.”
“Well, yeah, but at least in my case you’d have a <i>reasonable enough</i> excuse to assume I’d just be pulling your leg and dumb enough to pull it off. In your case, that’s… That’d be more of a Marl thing.” “So, uh. Unless it’s a loop where you don’t need me, please make sure I get to read those as soon as possible.”

[Probably between Firn and Gabbro, rather than Firn and Hal.]
A sigh. “Look. It’s not that I’m jealous or anything, but…” “Alright, maybe I’m jealous. It’s just… Why did that statue choose <i>you</i> rather than, like, anyone else? If the Nomai wanted someone to do something, then it just… It would’ve made so much more sense to pick an actual astronaut.”
“You would’ve wanted to be picked? It’s… it’s not fun, being in the loops. You don’t realize how many times I’ve seen or heard the others just… do the same thing on repeat.”
“I can imagine that.” “And… I just didn’t want <i>you</i> to be the one who has to go through it.”
“‘Cause you wanted to be the one.”
“It’s not like that!” “It’s just… I feel useless, okay? And I hate it. I can’t <i>tell</i> how long it’ll be until I stop being helpful, and just become a chore instead.”






"Hal, did... something happen last loop?"
(No answer for a while.)
"How?" The volume was so low, Firn pondered whether they had said anything at all. But then, it came again, ever so slightly louder: "How are you doing this?"
"Doing what? Holding up? I'm not the one who has to go through it over and over—"
"And that's the thing!" (They instantly calm down.) "You don’t *act* like it. How can you start up fresh and without any memory each loop, and yet..."
Firn crossed their arms proudly, giving a smug look. "Not get boring?"
"Yeah. Not asking questions. Staying unpredictable. You're predictable for like five minutes, and then— I only have to tell you the same few words each time, like three lines, and after that you're..."
They shrugged, as if it were obvious. "I read the ship log, buddy. Simple as that."
"The ship log doesn't have *nearly* enough information to let you do that!" () "...Does... does it?"
()
"...You've been leaving notes for yourself every loop."
"Yup."
"Where? How did I never—"
"Never bothered to look, maybe?" they shrugged. "Though to be fair, past me's put those behind a password. They got a bit personal after a while."
()
"And you just– You just... *guess* that you'd be leaving yourself notes? How?"
"Well, if we assume that part of the exchanges we have that are you just repeating the same thing and me answering the same way keeps going until you leave me to read the ship log... You told me the statues are the reason you and Gabbro remember, and I just remembered that my ship was built out of a chunk of yours. So I just went, 'Surely I would have tried it, right?' and, yep, turns out I did. Neat, huh?"
()
"What kind of... what have you been writing to yourself for it to work that well?"
All at once, Firn's smug expression melted immediately, leaving behind tight lips and slightly trembling fingers. "Hal, it's behind a password for a reason."
They raised an eyebrow at that. "What, leaving an embarrassing fact about yourself you're the only one to know about as proof that the time loop thing is real and it's really past you talking to yourself?"
Their only answer was a heavy shrug, followed by: "Everyone's got their secrets. I'd like to keep mine if you don’t mind."

One loop, when Firn is about to die after they had a very serious and emotionally heavy loop... they would reveal the password to Hal?
Or maybe it's less than a minute before the Sun engulfs the Sun station, after they both learned that it isn't responsible for the sun going supernova.
"Will you even remember me after this?"
"What sort of question—" () "Firn, what are you talking about?"
"The me from each loop. You can't remember all of them anymore, by this point. There's been so many—too many already. They've been blurring into each other, haven't they?"
(Hal wants to disagree, but can't find words.)
"What did loop 38 me do?"
"We've stopped keeping–" (Hal stops, realizing that the fact alone they and Gabbro stopped counting the loops only further proves Firn's point.)
Firn's lips trembled. "[Sap wine sucks]."
Hal blinked. "What?"
"If– if you need. If you want—" Another cough. "It’s [Sap wine sucks]."


Firn's entry when they add a password:
[  ] Uh, it's been getting a bit too private in there. I think it's better to hide this behind a password if I'm gonna be this brutally honest with myself.
[  ] Also, Hal was on the rather... scary side this time around. They must be getting tired of going through the same script or however they've surely decided to call it by now. Thirty-ish loops sounds like a lot. Hopefully having this password be something so random would be proof enough for future me's that they're not fooling around and that they need me to be (operative) as fast as possible.
[  ] This is start of loop me, so I hope other start of loop me's will get the same idea. It seems to have worked pretty well so far. Start of loops are gonna be nearly identical so far anyway, at least in what I'm looking at.
[  ] Okay. Password, password...
[  ] …Porphy’s still preparing their "good stuff." Ugh.
[  ] Well. If there is one thing I'm sure every future version of me will agree with, it's that sap wine sucks.
[v] No matter how much everyone else'll disagree, sap wine sucks. But at least you'll agree future me, won't you? Of course you do. You're gonna see them every time you're standing here, at the start of every loop, looking at the exact same scene time and time again.


Password-protected ship logs have two logs: one with the extra personal stuff, and the other one which is the first one Hal sees:
"Rules for loop #615:"
And a condensed bullet list of "Don’t ask Hal about X" and "Does Y do Z? Yes." ending with "Plan: Explore A, look for B in particular."
- Rule 0: Update the loop number first. Current number is for last loop.
- Rule 1: Don’t be hard on Hal. You've got less than four hours before the sun explodes and they have to deal with your memory getting wiped all over again.
- 1.bis: If you want to say something, think first about how likely you are to have already said it in a past loop. Questions about the current loop plan are relatively safe, even if you've asked them before they probably haven't heard those enough times to get tired of it yet.
- 1.ter: If you ask a question and Hal looks *noticeably* annoyed, you know you've fallen into a pattern. Write it down here so you don’t do it again.
- Rule 2: Don't question what they say about the Nomai or the time loop, or anything really. They have no time to fool around, and even if they're just taking a loop break to prank you for some reason, it'll be over soon and you won't even remember it.
-2.bis: If this line is still here, it means Hal never took a loop break to prank you. You're safe.
- 2.ter: If this line is still here and they look tired or at a loss this loop, try to convince them to take a break. It's been way too many loops and they haven't taken one for as far as this log exists.
[...]
- Turns out Gabbro *can* be helpful. Don’t ask about their ship. Don’t sass. You've sassed enough in the past loops, whatever you might think is something you definitely said before.
[...]
- Added #364: Sun Station isn't responsible for anything. The universe is dying. There's no saving anything.
- Added #364: I gave Hal the password. I'm sorry.
This part of the ship log is likely shaped similar to the in-game ship log, without the arrows? Or at least there's one big red sentence, and the rest in smaller text as details.


So there are loops going:
"So, Ember Twin?"
Hal startled. "Wait, did I tell you where we were going?"
Firn just gave them a smug shrug as they pulled the thrusters and launched off. "Latest entries on the ship log are all about it. I trust you already know where the sand and ghost matter are gonna be? Even if we'll end up dying anyway, I, uh, think I'd rather pick the supernova over either of those."
Hal blinked repeatedly, struggling to follow the fast pace of their locution. "A-are those even mentioned in the ship log—?"
"I'll need you to point me to the best spot to land." Firn was now fully turned towards them, casually resting an arm on the (dossier) of the pilot seat and the other against their (hanche), leaving the controls to the ship's computer alone. "I can't remember anything, remember?"
Hal buried their eyes inside their hands and took a deep deadpan breath. "Alright, now you’re just messing with me on purpose."
Firn's grin expanded. "Maybe."
Giving a defeated huff, Hal shook their head and looked past the cockpit, at the vastness of space... or rather, at a slowly but surely growing sphere of fire. "...You might wanna mind the autopilot."
Looking back at the controls, Firn instantly lost their confidence and flared the thrusters back as they barely managed to escape from the sun's strong pull, stiffling various creative swears aimed at Slate all the while. Once the threat fully avoided, they took a few dozen seconds to steady their hands and breath, then muttered sheepishly: "I, uh... Yeah, I'll really need you to point me the way, though. From my perspective, it *is* my first time in space."
Hal kept their lips tight for a moment, averting their gaze. No more words were exchanged until Ember Twin appeared close enough to land on.



Hal’s reaction to seeing Solanum:
Hal’s jaw dropped to the ground. In fact, they were currently not looking at the Quantum Moon’s ground, so who knew, maybe it even dropped past the ground and came out all the way to the other side of it.



"Promise me you’ll take some loops just to have some sleep, 'kay? Even if the loops start in the morning, I bet your mind still needs some rest."
"What, you suggest I just stay in bed till the supernova? What about you?" "What if they're loops where you... don't update the count? I thought that was important for you."
"Don't worry about it, I'll figure something out. Leave myself a message. I'll probably go to Hornfels to fetch the launch codes and only notice the ship log halfway through the loop or something, but I'll make sure the first thing I see when I do is the same as what I saw this time — and, uh, probably every time. As well as a message to not tell Hornfels about it."

(about the Strangers’ language)
"This is *fascinating*. Their entire culture revolves around light and dark, down to their writing! It took me forever to figure out that it's not just the writing that has meaning, but also the empty space *between* their glyphs! For so long I thought the additional dots and waves were meant to be little more than small alterations, but no, they define entire new words!"

While Hal is figuring out the Strangers’ language, Gabbro and Firn investigate… and talk about time loop stuff.

[While they are inside the simulation(?), or in a place where Firn can't access their ship log easily, Gabbro basically makes as little effort as possible to break patterns, so Firn repeats themself a lot and Gabbro doesn't stop them. Firn finds out soon enough and gets frustrated every time.]
Firn could not quite put their finger on it, but something felt... off. Maybe it was just Gabbro being Gabbro — from their own perspective, they had not seen each other in weeks, and they had never been close anyway. But their ship log claimed that they had changed quite a lot due to their time in the loops, so maybe their nonchalance and distant responses were caused by... something else.
They frowned warily. "...Gabbro, be honest with me. Have we had this conversation before?"
Gabbro answered immediately, without any surprise or the slightest sign of wavering in their tone. "Fifth time, I think." Not even a blink.
()
"Why don't you just lie to me, then? If you're gonna play with me you might as well pretend you never heard me say that before!"
"Would you like me to?"
"Wh—Of course not!"
"Then it's not the point."
"What is, then?"
"Trying to have you *relax*." "This is your first launch—" they silently tutted Firn when they tried to correct them, "—your *first launch*, buddy, and you've just learned about a whole new alien species with a spaceship the size of a whole planet. Have a good time. Enjoy the view. Keep all that insane catching up work for some other loop."
"And how am I supposed to enjoy *anything* when I know some other me has already done it all before? *Multiple* of them!?" "And the way you talk, your questions– Are you even *trying* to convince me of whatever point you're trying to make, or are you just repeating the same thing too just to keep me stuck in a pattern!?"
"Well, it was more like trying to delay the moment you'd realize until as late as possible. I tried everything I could think of. Neither idea worked."
"Neither idea," Firn deadpanned. "*Fifth* attempt."
"I'm not very creative, sorry."
"Say that to your quantum poem."
()
"It's *fine*, buddy. Hal isn't here all loop. You don’t have to worry about being predictable when they won't even notice. Just take it easy, will ya?"
"It's not about Hal! It's about– about— You can't just leave me like this!"
Fists curling and uncurling, they looked to the left, to the right– If Gabbro wasn’t about to break the pattern, then *someone* had to, *somehow*. Now what was the most un-Firnesque thing to do—
(Gabbro catches them and says that they already tried X and that it did not end well.) Firn scowled and then fell to their knees, screaming in rage.
“Every loop we’ve met, you’ve been wracking your brain in ways I didn’t even know were possible, and in ways I don’t think anyone ever <i>should</i>.”


"You really wish you were in the loop, huh?"
"*Duh!* What, do you wish you weren’t?"
Judging from Gabbro's dubitative expression as they diverted their gaze, Firn hoped that this meant this was their first time asking this one last question. Thank the *stars*, no thanks to Gabbro, they had finally managed to break the pattern.
"... a very good question. I might need a few dozen loops to ponder about the pros and cons."
"Loops you wouldn’t *have* if you weren’t in," Firn deadpanned.



Gabbro discusses the matter of whether it is a good thing or not to keep the whole universe in limbo, with everyone dying repeatedly. Firn is by far preferring that to making their death permanent, but the fact that they can’t remember the loops is giving their words less weight. Firn then argues that even though it's taking a while, Hal is working hard and as fast as they can, and that they know they are not dragging things on purpose.
"Hal’s work looks good on their bucket list," Gabbro nodded, "but what change is it going to make? They’re not doing it because it’s gonna save anyone. It’s a distraction so they don’t have to think about the fact that they can’t."





The first time Hal and Firn investigate the Stranger:

“Stars above, I could spend an <i>eternity</i> in here!”
Firn sighed dejectedly. “If only the sun weren’t exploding in just an hour or two.”
At first, Hal sighed dejectedly with a disappointed nod; but then, the reality of their situation dawned on them. A tiny shy smile, then an ever expanding grin, then a mesmerized epiphany, crawled up on their face. Stars in all four eyes, they turned to their friend in one swift move and grabbed their shoulders, arms trembling with excitement.
“Firn, I <i>have</i> an eternity! I have all the time in the universe to learn their language!” Firn tried to nod, though most of their head’s tilting was caused by the fact that Hal was shaking them like a [pine tree]. “I can’t believe I’m saying this— For once the time loop is a <i>good</i> thing!?”
Hal slowly stopped once they saw Firn’s expression shift, turning calm with a happy bittersweet smile.
“What?”
“Heh, nothing, don’t worry about it. I’m just glad to see you so excited. I was wondering how many loops it could’ve been since you last were this happy.”

Loop right after the first time they found the Stranger:

Ship log:
Note from Loop #[42], leave it up until it becomes obsolete: Don’t freak out about the number of loops growing rapidly without much (visible) progress being done. We found an alien ship that isn’t like anything we’ve ever seen before, and Hal is going to try cracking their language. You know how long it took to decipher the Nomai, so without the loops it would take them months, if not a few years. So yeah, don’t be surprised if we end up spending a hundred loops or two with just Hal locking themself up in a dusty attic scavenging for old books.
Just make sure they’re having fun, and if they are, leave them to it. It’s cool. It’s progress, and they’ve been ecstatic over the idea of spending however many loops it will take them, so it’s <i>good</i> progress.
Feel free to explore on your own in the meantime, that ship is HUGE. It’s also weird that we haven’t found anyone yet, dead or alive… You should investigate that.

<!--
Loop where the probe crashes into the ship:

Skin paling to a concerning grey from below their scales, Firn first found themselves paralyzed. Then, all their muscles were freed at once.
"*My ship!*" they shrieked out in alarm, running to the edge of the launching pad and almost falling over.
"That... that never happened before," Hal muttered in a frozen, breathless whisper.
Firn eyed them. "Uh-huh. Time loop, and something that never happened before. Totally adds up, Hal."
"N-no, you don’t get it—"

"Your ship logs! Here, if you'll just take a look at your sh—"
"You mean what's left of it," Firn sputtered with venom.

[When they look at the probe]
"It's of Nomai origin, no doubt about it. But what's it doing here...?"
()
Hal gasped in realization.
"It fires in a different direction each loop! The probe cannon— *That's* what they meant by only having to fire once!? And then—" Panting from the weight of their deductions, which they now thought they could have already figured out so, *so* long ago, they needed a moment to just gather their thoughts and tread this path again. Confirming that their reasoning had to be true, they staggered to their feet. "I— I-I have to find Gabbro."
Rushing away, they were momentarily stopped by Firn, who had grabbed their arm.
(...)
"Hal? Didn’t you say the plan this loop was to take off?"
Firn's eyebrows twitched at that. These two had never been close before, and they were positive they could not possibly have had any time to agree on any sort of 'plan.' Against their better judgement, they were still reluctant to accept something as ludicrous as whatever list of surreal events their morning had brought them, but...
Hal had failed to notice, too busy bringing a hand to the back of their neck and rubbing it awkwardly.
"Yeah, uh, about that... We're sort of grounded."
A snort, followed by some laughter, instantly resonated out of the receiver.
"For lack of experience or for medical reasons? Heh, probably both by this point."
Hal deadpanned. "Try 'Nomai probe decided to hit Firn's ship'."
()
"Welp, nap time for me then. See you next loop."
"*Gabbro.*"
"What do you want me to do without any ship?" "Just go have some quality time with the others, alright? At least you're not stranded alone."
()
"...So that time loop thing... It really is serious, huh?"
()
"Hal, why won’t you talk to me?"
"I can't do that every single time, Firn!"
()
Why were they being so much more obnoxious this time around? Sure, the frustration of losing their ship had to be factored in on top of their usual (upset-ness) at the start of every loop, but normally, by this point they would already be trusting them fully and following their directions with no objections. Why was this time so different? (Answer: because this is the first loop in a few dozens where Firn has zero access to the ship log.)
"Usually you're not that difficult," Hal muttered, too low for even they to notice that their lips had shaped the words.
"Just like *usually* I have my ship, huh?" And yet, somehow, Firn had heard it. Hal covered their mouth guiltily, turning away and not looking back.
(...)
Hal: "What is *up* with you this loop!? Usually you're never this... this..."
"This what? Skeptical? Sane?" they asked in exasperation. "Rational just like everyone else on this planet?"
"Obnoxiously predictable!"
Just as these words came out of their mouth, Hal suddenly froze. Finally, they realized.
It was not this loop. In actuality, they should have understood so much sooner that something had been up with Firn, indeed, but that this loop was supposed to be the only one that made sense.
Their behavior in every single loop before this one had been the anomaly.
Firn was unable to remember the loops. And yet, somehow, they had managed to remain mostly unpredictable... How? Because they and Gabbro were constantly bringing them into new places, always giving them new sights and events to react to? No, even then... There were so many lines they could have been repeating at the beginning of each loop. So many questions that they had asked in one loop, but never on the subsequent ones. The more loops went on, the more... complacent they had been. The least resistance they had showed to being asked to go through positively insane situations. The more they had even shrugged off the possibility of dying, just accepting the knowledge that they would be back in just a few hours, even boasting that, contrary to their two time traveler friends, they had at least the chance of not having to remember dying.
Somehow, Firn had no memory. And yet, they had evolved just like a real time buddy would.
This time loop's Firn was the only one who behaved like a memory-less Firn should; and the thought that *this* outcome—that losing a friend's trust and respect altogether in a matter of minutes, over and over and over again, never to be believed, only to face a wall of empty lines and predictability—was supposed to be the only normal one... This thought was so much more terrifying than any planet in the entire solar system could be.



Loop where the probe destroys the ship:
Hal, trying to find evidence to convince Firn that they are in a time loop: "What about... the launch codes? Don’t you think it's weird I already knew them?"
"You could've easily gotten them from Hornfels just by looking around."

Gabbro asking if Hal got grounded for medical reasons:
Hal snorted humorlessly. "Try Nomai probe destroying the ship."
Hornfels: "...Why would we ground *you* for medical reasons?"
Hal sent them a deadpan look. "You do *not* want me to answer that question."
Gabbro: "Wait, what Nomai probe? The one from the orbital station?"
"That one," they nodded. "It seems like we never realized it, but... I think the direction it fires is actually *different* each loop."
"How's that possible, though?" "Ooh. Unless..."
"Unless its firing in every direction *is the whole point* of the time loop. Yeah."


Loop where probe destroys ship: Hal flees into the quantum grove and finds Gabbro's poem.
Firn doesn’t get to find Hal when the loop is about to end and they see the sun growing larger and redder. Maybe they don't realize at all though.

<div id=loopcoreofgd></div>
<!--
When they get to the core of Giant’s Deep and see that the Eye was found on loop #xxx and that they are on loop #yyy:







Slowly, gradually, all four of Firn’s eyelids squinted, as their mouth pursed into a leery frown.
Finally, after a quick shake of their head, they muttered under their breath: “The count’s off.”
This is because Firn never knew about the loop where the ship was destroyed by the probe, and therefore did not know that they had not updated the loop number on that one.
Hal blinked in surprise. "What count? You've been counting the loops yourself?"
"Wh- Of <i>course</i> I have, haven't you? This was supposed to be the [xx]th. Or rather, I <i>thought</i> this was the [xx]th, until I saw this."
"How do you even keep track of the loops? Do you just..."
"-manually write down the loop number when writing in the ship log? Well, <i>duh</i>. I already have to start from scratch each loop, how else do you expect me to come anywhere close to staying on track when it's so hard to catch up?"
"I just… didn't think you would ever <i>need</i> to do that? I get writing down what the last few loops were about and our objectives, but what does knowing which loop we're in do that's of any use?"

“If the loop when the Eye was found was the same one when you and Gabbro got paired with the statues, then we should be on loop nine million – et cetera – and twenty-six. Why is it saying twenty-<i>seven</i>?”
Hal stared at them in confusion and disbelief. “What does it matter? They’re both <i>terrifyingly</i> huge numbers, one more or one less by this point— I especially don’t understand why it’d get <i>you</i> so worked up–”

(By this point, Hal realized that Firn had stopped listening, instead glaring down to the side and evidently thinking at high speed.)
"Hal. Was there at any point a loop where I never got to update the ship log and you never told me about it?"
()
“<i>Hal</i>,” they insisted with more urgency, “has there been a loop you’ve <i>hidden</i> from me?”
“What!? No!” “What would that even— there’s been <i>so many</i>, you can’t possibly be keeping track anyway, there’s not enough <i>time</i> for you to learn about all the times we’ve– I don’t know, tried to force a gooey mallow into the anglerfish’s mouth at the museum, or—” “Firn, I know not being able to remember is upsetting, but <i>what</i> is the issue here? What makes you think I’d <i>want</i> you to forget things on <i>purpose?</i> What sort of thing could that even…”
(Hal freezes, as slow realization dawns on them.)
Firn’s fists clenched shut. “So there <i>is</i> one,” they muttered with venom.
()
"...Only one, the probe had destroyed your ship at the very start of the loop-"
(Firn muttering to themself "Maybe I can still fix this...")
"- But I swear I wasn’t <i>hiding</i> it or anything, I was just so upset and I didn’t know-"
"How many loops ago was it?"
"I— I don’t know! That was while I was learning about the Stranger’s language, we’ve spent <i>hundreds</i> of loops there! There’s no way to…" “…Gosh. I’m… I-<span class=scaps>i</span>’m sorry.”
(pause. Hal is surprised to see Firn positively upset.)
"Why didn't you tell me?"
"I- Because I never tell you about the past loops? You've always caught up all by yourself with your own notes."
"Nothing of value happened there since we were stuck in the village, I don't see why you're making it that big of a deal. That loop didn't matter-"
"It matters to <i>me</i>, Hal! You have told me this happened!"
"You have <i>tonnes</i> of secrets of your own! Why shouldn't <i>I</i> ask you about all that secret info you've hidden behind a password?"
"Because it's all that I have!"
(...)
"I <i>know</i> I'll be forgetting everything soon. Why do you think <i>I'm</i> keeping track of everything? I can't even trust my own memory! If- if I can't trust the fact that <i>everything</i> is in there, how can I trust <i>anything?</i> For all I know, someone might as well be tampering with the logs and I'm just following blindly things that I didn't even write!" "You wanna know what the password is for? I'm putting <i>everything</i> in there- both a short and long version, all the time, I'm literally putting my <i>brain</i> into my ship. And I can't let you see that, because if you read it- what's gonna be left of me? I'll just become like the others, boring and predictable- Don't give me that look, I <i>know</i> you've been thinking that, I know that's why you're always avoiding the village. I just... I want to stay relevant. I want to- I want to be able to <i>be</i> your friend, someone you know but also someone who won't be <i>predictable</i>. <i>That's</i> what the password is for, Hal."
(...)
"Hal. <i>What happened</i> on that loop?"
"...I lost my best friend."
(Supernova is going soon?)
Firn looked up, trembled, turned to them with two pairs of eyes filled with the pain of betrayal.
“Oh yeah? Well, if you don’t want to lose them again—” (Hal flinched) “—next loop, you’ll tell me what happened.”
// "If we’re still friends—" (Hal flinched) "—next loop, you’ll tell me what happened."




Loop after that, Hal explains and apologizes:
"I'm sorry. I swear I wasn’t– I just hadn’t realized how much it mattered to you. Or understood *why* it mattered to you."
“Yeah, I-I guess… Look, I still need some time to <i>process</i> what even is happening, but– If I understand how it’s been for you, I’m sure it’d make sense for you to think the way you have.” They looked away. “…and it’d make sense that I wouldn’t tell you I don’t feel the same. Totally a <i>me</i> thing.”
"I'm... I'm going to die," they muttered. "You and Gabbro– you're going to die and come back. But me and everyone else? I'm going to *die* die. For real. Again and again. I don’t *know* if next loop me will be *me*. I have none of the memories– I don’t feel like I'm the same person as the previous me's. I read the latest ship logs– I talk to myself like I'm talking to someone else. Most of it is just giving instructions. Telling future me's what to do, and what not to do. Sometimes it says why. Most times it doesn't. It also says not to ask. Not enough time."
()
"I think that's why I've been counting the loops. It's how many times another me has died. A me that was different from the last one, and won't be the same as the next one." "...or at least, that's what I've been telling myself. It's when next loop me becomes the exact same as current loop me that it'll stop having a point." "Is that selfish...?"

"You're… always overthinking everything that way?"
"When I can't ask questions, it's the only thing I have."
"You don’t have to put that much pressure on yourself, you're already amazing just the way you are!"
"Hal. I know you *wish* it could be that way. I do too. But isn't that one loop you told me about exactly *proof* that I'm really not?" "You still don't get it? I can't tell how many loops it's been unless I read the logs. I can't *tell* what questions I could have asked hundreds of times, or things I would have said on multiple loops, unless I left notes with answers and instructions. How'd the loop start, again? I bet you've had the script optimized by now. So when does the script *end?* How many minutes do you have to relive each time before I *finally* stop being obnoxious?"
()
"You’re gonna get tired of me eventually," they asserted, and before Hal could object, they shook their head. "I'm not mad. You don’t have to be mad at yourself for it. It’s already natural to grow bored and annoyed when it's [Spinel retelling the exact same story each campfire over and over], I can't even begin to imagine how much torture it is when the whole *universe* is stuck on repeat like that." "How hard is it to be with the others back in the village? Is it hard to even, like, just *be* in the crater? Do you know everyone's schedule by now or something?"
"N-not to *that* point, I've never stayed in the village for nearly long enough to remember that." (Looking down.) "Though I'm..." "...trying not to think of Hornfels. Or Marl, and (), and () too I guess— ...but mostly Hornfels. It just... hurts."
"So you're gonna get tired of me, too." (Hal sends them a look about to break down, terrified.) "We both wish it weren’t the case, but it's really a question of *when*, not *if*. And if the 'when' is still an unknown variable — If it's the *only* thing I have *any* sort of control on... I've just been working on delaying that when for as many loops as I could."
"And you've been amazing at it," Hal heaved.
Firn gave a small, slow nod. "Thanks. I'm just upset I can't keep at it forever. It's been tough, there keeps getting more and more stuff to read each loop. I'm scared one of these I'll just... no longer have the time to read any of it. Or like, important parts of it." "...heh. You think it'd look as if I had dementia or something? Like one loop I'm fine, and starting from the next one I start *mysteriously* 'losing' some core memories from your early loops?"
["Memories you never had." Because they were not the same Firn.]
(Maybe even getting tired of Gabbro eventually.)
"What core memories? Did anything from the first loops still matter that much now? —I-I mean, *you* matter, and– it's– it's just that if *you* don't always remember them– What kind of memory would be so important that you'd *need* to relearn them every single time?"
"You really don't know?" (Silence. Faltering smile.) "...Good. Guess that means I'm good at my job, then."
"What...?"
"The observatory."
Oh. *Those* early loops.
"I only have notes starting from loop six, of course. But those are enough. They're enough for me to know that whatever I do, I *can't* have you go through that again. Not for as long as I can."
()
"Six loops were enough to break you once. It's been [] loops since then. I don’t know how many more you'll have to go through before we find a solution." "The day I become predictable through and through, it's over. I *can't* let that happen."
"And how many loops will it be before *you* break!?" Hal cried out.
(Silence. Slowly, horror dawns on their face. Firn's ghost of a tired smile creaks up, distant and shy.)
"None. Guess that's the perks of not getting to remember." "I only have to hold on for a couple hours. It's tough but doable. And if it means you're not suffering as much, and we're making progress towards *finally* getting rid of that problem, it's worth it." ("It's in everyone's interest that I make those count.")

———————

"I think I found it."
"Found what?"
"The hole. The part where there could've been a missing loop."

Ship log:
——————
Start of loop #xxx.
Hal looks... upset by something. Like, <i>really</i> upset. Last loop's logs ended at around one hour into the loop, so I assume we may have both died? (at least me?) Apparently we were in [Dark Bramble... Yeah, I guess death by anglerfish isn't pleasant.] / [that thing called the “Stranger”? I’m not sure what kind of dangers it has, but I guess there must be unpleasant ways to die in there.]
…Either that or I was the only one dying and they had to deal with my corpse the rest of the loop? Yikes. Yeah, that might be it. They’re looking at me like I’m the problem. So, uh, note to self: try not to die early this time around.
——————

"Go on." "Write down what you want. Take the time you need."
"Thanks."

——————
Start of loop #xxx — except, uh, this is Firn from loop #yyy speaking.
This loop wasn’t documented until now for the very simple reason that I didn’t even get to have my hands on the ship log AT ALL, or even the ship altogether for that matter.
That loop brought back bad memories of the observatory
Hal told me about it, I'm choosing to trust them. The only reason they took this long was because they didn't realize it was important, not because they didn't want to hide it. Or, well, they sort of did hide it, but like, not on purpose. It's like how they won't tell us how dying on Ember Twin feels like, 'cause it just *hurts* and that's that.
It hurt to hear it. I'm mad at loop #xxx me, and I'm sure every future loop me who has the ability to read this will agree.
PS: We're cool. Future me, don't take it too hard on them, they had their reasons and they just legit didn't know we had any reason to want to know. They understand now. I made them promise that they'll always tell me about that kind of thing in the future, and I think they will keep it.

(Firn can't see the lights prior to being paired. Inside the ATP, they will be confused when Hal is mesmerized by the flow of information near the end of the loop.)
Hal's ears dropped in worry. "You... you don’t see them?"
Firn frowned in confusion, turning their head in various haphazard directions before coming back to face them with disappointment. "See what?'
"The lights," "they're purple, just like the glowing masks, and they're being taken out of them and to somewhere else,"
Firn's mouth opened ever so slightly in silent shock. "Hal. None of the masks are glowing."
() "How did you think I knew which ones are active, then?"
"Because you speak Nomai? I just assumed you were reading the signs." "Well, that and the fact that you could've been here before, but. That's your first time in here, right?"
Hal nodded shakily. "I've– I've seen those masks in projection pools before, and they were already glowing back then. I don’t understand."
() "Those lights... you think that's the information those Nomai computers have?"
"I assume so?"
"Then maybe you can see them because you're a part of it," they hypothesized. Then, with a short and sad breath, they lowered their head. "And I can't because... I'm not."



[Everyone expresses immense relief when they notice the previously dark mask turn on again. A few moments later, Firn radioes to tell everyone that the pairing was successful, and right in time because Firn got the alarm that the sun had exploded and the supernova was getting close. Does Firn joke about getting to die for the first time, and is cut short before the end of their sentence?]






Post ATP: Hal could also, instead of removing the OPC from the loop, at first slightly alter its code so that every probe will instead be sent in the same direction, that of the same probe which found the Eye. This would open the possibility to then follow the probe and find it themselves, along with the signal blocker; and this would allow Firn’s ship to remember the coordinates.

Firn offers one loop to depart as soon as they wake up, alone, and follow the probe. If they land on the Eye, then the Eye will reject them? With a Quantum Solanum, if so:
"It is not time." "You seek knowledge, but only came to this place because you revel in impermanence. This place is not one for indecision."
"I'll, uh– Look, I'm sorry, I *really* didn't even know what I was about to find here, and now that I think about it it probably *should* have clicked that it'd be more important than I'd realized, but…"
Not-Solanum tilted its head. "Do not misunderstand. You are welcome here. Everyone is. It simply cannot be time yet." "Come back once you are ready."
Head trembling more than nodding, Firn took one step backwards, then a second, then a third. "I– I will. Sorry again, for, uh. I don’t know what for, but I’m sorry."
When Firn tries to take off and get out of the signal blocker's range, a vortex and thunder catches up with them, and they scream that they're sorry to have upset what might as well have been the universe itself, and then everything ends— when they open their eyes, they find themself inexplicably near Timber Hearth, and catch a glance of the quantum moon in the corner of their eye before it's gone with their first blink.
Hands shaking too hard to be trusted anywhere near the controls, Firn instead opted for turning on the radio.
"Hal? Can you hear me?"
"Firn! We lost contact for a few seconds. Are you okay?"
Firn frowned. "...A few <i>‘seconds’</i>?"
"Yeah, that was super quick, even the probe isn't back out yet it looks like. I guess you just took a peek to catch the coordinates and then flew right back out?"
Firn’s heart stopped for a moment.
The coordinates. Did their ship record the *coordinates?*
They unbuckled and dashed to their ship log, searching through their flight history—
…And took a deep breath.
Their ship seemed to not have been able to record the coordinates per se (its dependency to the Deep Space Satellite and the signal blocker perhaps having more to do with this part than *whatever everything else had been all about*), but it did keep an accurate record of multiple points throughout their trajectory, which had been on top of this perfectly linear for the majority of it. It was not *perfect*, but it was more than enough for someone like Chert or Hornfels to compute various numbers out of this raw data, and obtain the Eye’s coordinates — in Hearthian units. In units comprehensible to any Hearthian ship. In units which did not require the Vessel.

(Hal lost contact with them because of the signal blocker anyway. Next loop, when they ask Firn what they saw, they are shocked......... to not remember, somehow? Or if they do, they mention seeing a Nomai speaking Hearthian and how weird the conversation they had was, about the Eye 'rejecting' them because it was 'not time' yet. Asking the real Solanum, she muses that it is because of the time loop. One can only enter the Eye itself to collapse possibilities, but the ATP creates endless possibility. Trying to enter the Eye while the time loop is active could lead to... unforeseeable consequences, which the Eye might reject for the sake of everyone's safety. Solanum is still enthralled that they managed to find the Eye, and urges them to seek it. Now that the ATP has fulfilled its function, it can be put to rest; and the legacy of the Nomai can fall into Hearthian hands.

While Firn follows the probe, Hal made it to the ATP/core of GD with the help of Gabbro, who would have first had to land on TH, then borrowed another ship?) and follows in real time.
Firn gasped. "The probe disappeared!"
In their radio, Hal gasped as well, for an entirely different reason: "It found the Eye! Firn, it's—"
Two things happened at once. First: the radio died. Second: where nothing stood a fraction of a second ago, now faded into view a massive, black, thundering and pulsing planet.
Firn had made it past the Stranger’s signal blocker.
[NB: the probe likely couldn't send the data to the OPC while it's within the cloaking though.]











Pairing Hornfels and Slate:
Firn: "Gotta give you a warning, the first time is totally going to feel overwhelming and intrusive. ...Though the other times are also going to feel intrusive. Um. It's just not as bad. On average." "...Anyway. Are you both in position?"
Hornfels took a short breath, wishing they could rub their eyes without having their helmet in the way. "R– Ready, I believe." They truly were not, but the prospect of coming all this way, of having given the two hatchlings their word (both figuratively *and* literally in the form of a time-transcending audio recording), only to then not only go back on it but to also *forget* the hurt such self-centered decision would inevitably cause to the Hearthian species as a whole, felt like a much more terrifying outcome.
From the other side of the room, Slate crossed their arms. Their leg was (having nervous tremors). "Just get on with it."
Firn eyed them both, then turned to their signalscope. "Heard that, Hal?"
Static. "I'm injecting the code, then. Brace yourselves, you two."
The room turned back to silence, and for a few short instants, stillness instilled it. But the two adults only had the time to share one last glance of anticipation and worry before two mechanical *clangs* resonated simultaneously, and both statues readjusted themselves to meet with four pairs of eyes each.
Watching from a distance, Firn gasped as they saw purple lights — the same glowing eyes they had been met with on the first loop the universe had allowed them to remember, and the same incorporeal trails of condensed information they had seen the Ash Twin Project absorb straight from the masks at the end of this very same first loop.


Loop after Gossan was paired:
They looked down at their hands. Their gloves were back
"What in the…" Studying themself, they found their borrowed spacesuit gone and replaced with their atmosphere-requiring flight equipment instead.
()
"Gossan?"
Their ears twitched at the sound of their name, and they raised their head, in a more (saccadé) motion than they would have thought.
Hal’s voice had been small and quiet, just like their current anxious look was as they stared down at them.
"What happened?" They knew, and yet…
"We’re back to Timber Hearth," the hatchling
()
The founder went back to staring at their hand, and the unfamiliar and daunting feeling of falling to sleep somewhere, and waking up elsewhere, with the knowledge that the unfathomable hands of time itself had tucked them in bed and changed their clothes without their knowing.
"It's okay if you need a minute," Hal reassured. "Stars do I know I wished someone could've given me one on my first loops."
Gossan trembled, a nervous smirk appearing on their face against their will. "Was every time before the last one the same to me? The last time, before you came to, you had suddenly gone unresponsive for a whole minute or two, and…" Their eyes fell on their left hand, in position to delicately seize a chin that wasn't there. They shuddered at the question of just how many times they had adopted it. "…That must have been uncomfortable."
"It… got annoying fast, yeah."
Gossan frowned. "You were awake right away this time, though." A blink, then a short gasp. "Unless…"
"Yep. I guess we’ll get to be frozen together from now on," Hal joked shyly. "Good thing Marl didn’t seem to notice."
"Last time, I called after them because of the state you were in," Gossan mumbled. "I suppose… nobody will do that anymore."

Closing their eyes and taking a deep breath, they rolled their fingers into uncomfortable fists. "I am never going to get used to this," they sighed.

Loop where they tell the founders about Feldspar, and Gossan asks to go there alone with Hal as their guide. They die by anglerfish due to Gossan's anxiety and emotions making their hands unstable, and Hal, having gone through it before, tells them straight away (but not to the others through the radio).

Hal gritted their teeth, bracing for a short impact that would never physically come, then went closer to the comms. "Sorry, everyone. We're– we're not making it. Don't worry, we're gonna meet you in the next one, just go do something else in the meantime. We'll be– fine. We'll be fine."
Hal turned off the radio before anyone could respond or object. When they turned around, slowly, they met with Gossan's horrified expression.
"Hal, I'm... I was careless, you shouldn’t have to pay for my mistake..." "There is no way being digested by an anglerfish is going to be anything but slow and painful," they whispered shakily, surprising themself with even the fact that they would be brought to say such thing.
Hal nodded, taking a deep sigh. "Fortunately for the both of us, this isn't the way we're gonna go this time."
Three eyes widened at once. "You don’t mean..."
Hal had walked all the way to the reactor and then crouched down, hand dangerously close to the opening. "I'm afraid I am," and Gossan shuddered at the lack of emotion in the hatchling's statement. "We've got options. I know my favorite, but, it'd be selfish to force it upon you without asking."
Gossan stared at Hal’s hand, ready to open the protective shell and expose whatever was under there to whatever plans they had evidently already put to motion before.

(Next loop)
Gossan gasped and staggered back,
Something grabbed them and pulled them towards an unknown destination, and they tried to resist, but this force had more motivation and momentum than their body had with how little balance it had and how dangerously close to the cliff it was—
…Oh.
Gossan opened their eyes, and saw that Hal had pulled them into an awkward embrace, dragging them away from the edge of a cliff they had almost slipped over.
Well that would have been an embarrassing way to go, and a difficult loop to explain.








The plan is to pair Slate first, given their proximity to Firn’s ship, and for that they decide to go with one of the statues in the sun station given the tighter time limit. Slate’s recording to themself is rather brief and concise.
“Hey. Uh. Me. I’m supposed to be saying something to convince you that there is a time loop, but I bet that just hearing my own voice talking to me through a recording should be enough on its own. So whatever I’ll say next after that… it’s probably just going to be words so you can be sure that it’s really your own voice talking, and not someone faking it.” “Whatever the rookie tells you to do, do it. Judging from the calculations they did last time, we have less than two hours before we’ve blown our chance to get in. And, I already said yes to that plan, so don’t be a voidhead. They’ve been having a way harder time than you could ever imagine. Should’ve been there for them much sooner.”
Maybe they also attempt to have Hornfels get the other sun station statue at the same time? It would be funny if they got Slate in the ship, and while they wer listening to the recording, Firn just got the ship to land on or right by the entrance of the observatory, right as Hal is pulling Hornfels out.
Firn’s head popped out from the hatch, upside down. “Come on! That maneuver was hard enough as it is, might as well make it worth it!”
Hornfels’ mouth was hanging open, Hal rolled their eyes. “I <i>thought</i> we had agreed that you wouldn’t try that one again.”
“It worked <i>this</i> time!” they argued with a pout. “Told you I could do it.”
Hal grabbed Hornfels’ hand and pushed them towards the beam before the elder could regain enough words to protest. “Yeah, it just took you four loops.”
“I can finally <i>learn</i> how to pilot that thing and have it stick, you said it yourself! Please let me have this.”
(Hal is not coming due to the lack of space in the ship…? There is only Firn, Slate (who was already convinced) and Hornfels. As soon as Hornfels is in, Slate points them to the ship log and gives them the helmet, giving them the most serious and devastated look they can manage without losing face and looking desperate.)
“Your turn,” they merely said, nodding their head towards the screen. Hornfels saw that an audio recording was ready to be played, and that for some unfathomable reason, it had their name on it. Looking back to Slate, they find no explanation other than four stern and determined eyes, putting on a brave face yet hiding so much more. “We’re on a tight schedule, so try to listen quick,” Before the engineer turned around, they shared one last piece of advice, this time failing to hide their pain and fear. “You’re… gonna want to sit down.”
And with that, Slate kneeled down and tinkered with the floor, catching Firn’s attention. As soon as the young astronaut saw what they were doing, their eyes widened and they sputtered in confusion:
“Wait, why are you opening the hatch?”
Slate rolled their eyes, sighing. “Look, I get it, we have to be quick, and you managed to pull off a crazy stunt for the sake of it. But if we’re going out there, we are going to need <i>spacesuits</i>, genius.”
(Meanwhile, Hal went up to the observatory and uses the comms to radio Gabbro, spending time together just chatting.)
By the time Slate jumped back into the ship with two spare suits, Hornfels had pulled out the helmet and was staring into the void between matter itself, face distorted with horror, mouth covered by a shaking hand. Just as Slate had predicted, they were sitting in a corner of the ship, surrounded by the Outer Wilds Ventures posters they had themselves contributed to designing, gripping the ledge of the tiny wooden bench as if the ship were in motion with its artificial gravity defunct.
(Hal may, in fact, go in the ship, maybe. If they do, then it is because they part ways on Ash Twin in order to go to the ATP and tinker with the masks, while Firn, Slate and Hornfels tinker with the statues one at a time. Or… do they tinker with the statues? Or is the ATP the part that needs tinkering instead? Also, it is most likely better to maneuver those with a Nomai staff, actually, something which only Hal would have been able to entirely figure out.)

(On the Sun station, Firn is asking Slate for some of the tools on their belt or in their box, quickly tinkering )


Gossan:
“Please take care of the hatchlings for me. They shouldn’t have that burden on their shoulders. They can’t do it alone, and they shouldn’t have to.”

<wip>
<p>When Hal finally notices that the reason why Firn is so upset isn’t <i>just</i> because they’re confused. They look considerably more shaken than before, and though Hal is certain that their own behavior is to blame, they finally realise that there is more to it.</p>
<p>“I… I always see you by the computer.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah, but— I’m checking the ship log, you know? There’s not nearly enough time for me to read everything, but. I’m trying.”</p>

<p>In the loop when Hal discovers that Firn has been writing diary-like entries in the ship log, Firn somehow died due to feeling useless compared to Hal and Gabbro. Gabbro convinces Hal to take that time to do some brainstorming, saying that they noticed that Firn kept taking notes whenever they had time alone.</p>

<p>Had… had this section of the ship log always been here? How had they missed it, all this time?</p>
</wip>




<div class=shiplog_diary><!-- LOOP 3 --><h2>Reading Entry: “so time got wacky and i forgot stuff TWICE but my ship didn’t what in the brambling geysers is going on.log”</h2>
<p class=time>115s 32:14</p>
<p>Alright I have no idea if this is going to work. I don’t even know if it’ll be of any use since we can’t be sure that whatever happened twice already is gonna happen a third time or more. Chances are this is just going to be a big waste of time. Still, gotta give it a try, right?</p>
<p>So, uh. Hey, future me! (???) Or Hal, if you find this and read it. Not sure if you’ll do that. Bet you must be having a lot of better things to do, or just a lot of things on your mind to worry about. I shouldn’t be burdening you with my ramblings, especially not when I’m… well, about to forget everything. Again. Probably.</p>
<p>Anyway, future me, here’s the thing. Hal and Gabbro both think that a time loop is <i>likely</i> going on, and the fact that my ship log was filled with notes <i>I</i> had somehow written FROM THE FUTURE even though it’s my first time in here is what I’d call <i>pretty solid proof</i> that they’re actually serious.</p>
<p>So yeah somehow these two have been stuck repeating this morning a few times already. Only twice, Hal says, but that’s enough for us all to make the guess that this is <i>probably</i> going to happen again. Time is going to repeat until we figure out what to do to fix it.</p>
<p>We also have a hypothesis as to why they’re the only ones who can remember the previous times. It’s just a guess, again, but that’s pretty much the only lead we have, and it sounds like the most sensical thing we can come up with for now.</p>
<p>On their first loop <span class=smol>(??? Yeah, gonna stick with ‘loop’ for now, whatever)</span>, something happened to them both. Remember the Nomai statue Hal told you about, the one Gabbro brought back from Giant’s Deep? For some reason, that statue opened its eyes and did something to Hal, like if it read their memories or something. And the same thing happened to Gabbro with another statue on Giant’s Deep.</p>
<p>And that got me thinking. This ship’s computer has been built with a chipped part of Hal’s statue in it. So maybe this is why the ship remembers too.</p>
<p>No matter what happens, IF the time loop really is a thing, then I’m going to forget everything soon. But the <i>ship</i> won’t. So yeah. Here I am, talking to myself. Hypothetically. Hoping somehow this message will make it to the next loop and future me will find it, or however that works.</p>
<p>It’d be cool if I could catch up without having to rely on Hal and Gabbro. I can only imagine how annoying that would be for them. So, yeah, fingers crossed on two things. First, that this will work. Second, that future me will have the same idea as present me and check the computer for notes.</p>
<p>Anyway that’s been a lot of rambling, and IF the time loop is real, I’ve only got so long before everything’s over. Lots of investigating to do in the meantime. Will write a summary later of what we’re gonna find out this time around.</p>
<p class=time>116s 43:12</p>
<p>Okay according to Hal the sun will explode before the next sunrise, so now would be a good time for me to leave notes. Future me, if this message makes it across, this is what we found out during this loop:</p><ul>
<li class=red>[Insert findings<!-- related to the Hanging City? Only Riebeck is the one doing the discoveries here, Firn doesn’t have enough time to leave the Attlerock. -->]</li>
</ul>
<p>Third loop’s me signing out, over. Good luck future me (if you ever become a thing), let’s hope this wall of text won’t get erased forever in like twenty minutes or something.</p>
<p class=time>116s 44:03</p>
<p>The sun is… not looking good. I’m pretty sure now that it’s not going to be permanent, but <i>still</i>. Can you imagine??</p>
<p>I don’t want to <i>die</i>. Or figure out how painful it’s going to be.</p>
<p class=time>116s 46:43</p>
<p>Hal says it’ll be over quick, at least.</p>
<p class=time>116s 46:49</p>
<p>I hope they’re not lying to make me feel better.<br>That explosion is slower than it has any right to be.</p>

<p>But also OH GEEZ, oh no, the time loop is real and we’re already close to like halfway through. Why did Gossan have to rope me into fixing their mining equipment!?</p>
<p>Ok that means there’s no time for fooling around, it’s my turn to keep future me up to date and get as much work done as I can. I’ll come back later with a full report. I’m leaving condensed notes in real time in the main ship log as usual, but I thought it’d probably be better to make a different version here as well at the end of each loop, just for me.</p><p>Though there’s probably going to be more rambling. Oops.<!-- Hey, at least I’ll leave those summaries in red, alright? Future me, try not to forget to do that too.--></p>

<p class=time>115s 28:52</p>
<p>HA! Sweet, this seems to be going along nicely. Except for the part where it’s STILL ALREADY HALFWAY THROUGH THE LOOP AND <i>AGAIN</i> I WASTED TIME ON THE ATTLEROCK MAKING THE SAME DISCOVERIES FOR THE FOURTH TIME IN A ROW LIKE A COMPLETE VOIDBRAIN.</p>
<p>And also what was it about me last loop?? Saying ‘yeah i’ll give you some news soon’ and then just. Not. Did something… <i>stop</i> me from giving those news at the end of the loop?</p>

<p class=time>115s 39:02</p>
<p>Screw you. Screw everything. Hal is in shambles and if I don’t figure out SOME kind of solution then nothing’s ever going to get any better because NOBODY ELSE seems to have ANY STARBLOWING CLUE how to make a change, and by the time they start trying it’s ALREADY TOO LATE.</p>
<p>I managed to get Hal in my ship, at least. That’s a new one according to them. So is blasting off into space, but that one isn’t too surprising.</p>
<p>They don’t like space. Or the ship. I tried my best to be steady and gentle, but even with that and the gravity crystal they <i>definitely</i> were trying not to throw up after the landing.</p>
<p>But that’s not even the worst part. I give them the opportunity to get <i>anywhere</i> they want in the entire solar system, and their first pick was the most BORING choice they could’ve ever made. And it was boring <i>on purpose</i>. Can you IMAGINE how broken and done with everything they must be if they picked ENDLESS SAND over like, I don’t know, literally <i>anything</i> with tons of Nomai writings to dive into and spend the entire loop reading in peace???</p>
<p>At least they seem to like the “novelty” and the fact that I <i>finally</i> got them out of that repeating cycle of being stuck with Hornfels and ME ASKING FOR THOSE BRAMBLING LAUNCH CODES. For <i>Hearth’</i>s sake, Hal, you KNOW the launch codes by now, why didn’t you just meet me at the campfire and show them to me right away?</p>
<p>...That being said I probably wouldn’t believe them and Slate likely wouldn’t be much help either. That’d just be a different kind of getting stuck. I don’t think Hal knows about <i>these</i> secret logs and I don’t even know for sure if they’d be convincing fast enough on their own because <i>I</i>’m still trying to wrap my head around the idea that a time loop could ever be real and I am not going to trust myself to not be a GEYSER JUMPING VOIDBRAIN if Hal isn’t already right in front of my face looking like they’re about to melt into a puddle AND explode at the same time. LIKE THEY DID THIS LOOP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now I gave them free reign over the pilot’s seat and they’re just napping on the controls. I think they’re crying.</p>
<p>So yeah. Screw you, me. Screw the time loop. Screw the entire universe. Hal doesn’t deserve any of this and I have been doing NOTHING to help them.</p>
<p class=time>115s 39:48</p>
<p>Oh RIGHT, I almost forgot: screw Gabbro too. You wouldn’t even REMEMBER <i>(HA)</i> they’re supposed to be in the loop with Hal given how LITTLE they’ve been contributing.</p>
<p class=time>115s 42:12</p>
<p>...........This is loop 6, by the way.<br>Maybe I should have started with that.</p>

<p class=time></p>
<p>Wow, it really works, just as I thought! Will give news near the end of the loop then.</p>
<p class=time></p>
<p>Loop report:</p><ul>
<li><span class=red>Don’t bother trying to link with your own statue.</span> We already tried. Don’t ask Hal about it. They and Gabbro didn’t say it, but I bet the reason past loop me didn’t write anything about it <span class=smol>(…or anything at all, the only reason I know there was a loop before this at all is because Hal told me, and even then Hal wouldn’t tell me anything about it, I had to ask Gabbro instead)</span> was because I died before I could write it down.</li>
<li>Because yeah, turns out <span class=red>there <i>are</i> other ways to die</span> before the supernova takes you. Wow, it’s almost as if space was like, <i>dangerous</i> or something, who could’ve thought? Voidbrain.</li>
<li>For this reason it’s probably for the best that you write your notes here as well <span class=red>in real time</span>, rather than wait near the end of the loop.</li>

<p class=time>115s 14:23</p>
<p>Sooooo we got stranded on the Attlerock. Wanted to try teaching the ropes to Hal just in case one of these loops they get tired of me and want to jump straight to stealing the ship, but they, uh, missed the landing. They also missed the <i>launching</i>, but Hal made me promise I wouldn’t tell anyone about the fact that it was the geyser we crashed into that got us into orbit, instead of the thrusters.<br>Well my name isn’t ‘anyone’ and nobody’s reading those logs anyway. So. Sorry Hal, memory was too funny to let it fade into oblivion.</p>
<p>Thankfully the computer still works, it would have been bad if I couldn’t write this loop’s findings.<br>Not that there’s a lot of <i>findings</i> to begin with, unless you’d like to call ‘Hal now knows this ship has an eject button’ a ‘finding.’</p>
<p>We’ve got a lot of time left before the sun explodes, but Hal said we already explored everything there is to explore about the Nomai ruins here in a few past loops, and with the ship in such a bad state, we won’t be able to move from here. We radioed Gabbro, who convinced Hal to go roast some mallows with Esker.</p>
<p>In the meantime I thought I’d take that time to move the important reports to a new log, instead of keeping all the important info drowned in this mess of… whatever this is. Talking to myself. It’s been a <i>wild</i> trip reading messages left by alternate versions of myself that technically never existed.</p>
<p>Anyway, yeah, there’s a big red <span class=red>“IMPORTANT INFO”</span> button now, you literally can’t miss it. Future me, I know you will forget a lot of things, but I hope you’re not gonna forget how to read.</p>
<p class=time>115s 58:51</p>
<p>Aaaaaaand done! There we go, all caught up. Looks WAY less daunting to read that way.</p>
<p>I may go reunite with them, now, if they still have some mallows left.</p>
<p class=time>116s 02:47</p>
<p>They don’t have any mallows left. How greedy, the both of them. Told them to leave me in peace with my sulking. They’re better raw anyway.</p>
<p class=time>116s 24:43</p>
<p>Hal’s trying to be optimistic, telling me they’re getting used to it, but I can tell they’re terrified in space. Not as much as Riebeck, probably, but that’s still definitely not their element, and Riebeck had <i>tons</i> of training before Gossan let them get anywhere close to even <i>looking</i> at a ship’s controls.</p>
<p>I wonder how it would have gone for me if I’d been the one paired with the statue. It’d suck a lot, but. At least I’m the one with the ship and the training. And the translator. And all the cool gadgets.</p>
<p class=time>116s 47:21</p>
<p>The sky is so dark. Is it just me, or are the other stars gone too?</p>
</div>






<div class=shiplog_diary><h2>Reading Entry: loop_51.log</h2>
<p class=time>116s 29:19</p>
<p>Got stranded in the middle of nowhere. No way back.<br>Told Hal and Gabbro not to bother.</p>
<p>Guess now all that’s left for me to do is see what kills me first: supernova grilling me or oxygen running out?</p>
<p class=time>116s 31:42</p>
<p>I’m not completely sure why I’m recording. I’m leaving notes and summaries for Hal’s and everyone’s sake, of course, but that doesn’t explain why I’d spend time leaving, like, my <i>thoughts</i> in here. It feels weird to just write <i>that</i> down, every loop.</p>
<p class=time>116s 35:10</p>
<p>I guess, if any future me ponders the same question… I guess it might be because I’d like to… I don’t really know. Be remembered? For this loop to matter?</p>
<p>Heh. How could this loop even matter when I’m stuck here with no fuel and just waiting to die.</p>
<p class=time>116s 35:41</p>
<p>Funny how I never noticed how <i>big</i> everything is out there.<br>The supernovae are pretty.</p>
<p class=time>116s 35:50</p>
<p>Geyser brambling void of all <i>black holes</i>, I sound like Gabbro.</p>
<p class=time>116s 36:03</p>
<p>…Nah, Gabbro probably wouldn’t bother saying any of this out loud. They’d just keep it inside their head and let the thoughts disappear.</p>
<p class=time>116s 38:15</p>
<p>I think the Interloper fell into the sun. Just like that. Not even a sound or an explosion or anything. Just went straight into it in silence.<br>Is that how it’s gonna look when it’ll be our turn?</p>
<p class=time>116s 41:43</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes left. My mallows are on the oxygen. Might depend on how much I keep talking though.</p>
<p class=time>116s 45:14</p>
<p>In just a few moments I’ll be gone too. That’s… I don’t know if I’ll be <i>gone</i> gone, or if it’s just going to be a little part of me that gets erased over and over? But every little part of me that gets erased… because of Hal and Gabbro, they’ve all been different, at least a little.</p>
<p>Each loop, it’s like it’s a slightly different me that dies. Just different enough to not be the same person.</p>
<p class=time>116s 48:09</p>
<p>I don’t want to forget. I don’t want to disappear.</p>
<p class=time>116s 55:34</p>
<p>I think the sun’s shrinking. Must mean it’s over for me, huh…?</p>
<p>Look at that, oxygen tank managed to lose the race. Yay me, Hal said it was the more painful option.</p>
<p class=time>116s 55:43</p>
<p>I’m scared. I don’t want to die.</p>
<p class=time>117s 00:17</p>
<p>I’m scared Hal is going to forget me.</p>

<div class=shiplog_diary>
<p class=time></p>
<p>Say, Hal. Ever thought sometimes of just spending a loop or two, like… just taking a break? Grilling a mallow or two, drinking some of Porphy’s “Good” Stuff? I hate it, but you don’t, and it’s about you here, so.</p>
<p>Look, I bet being killed by the sun isn’t fun, but I don’t know if by this point it even matters that much anymore. Maybe “wasting” a loop or two for the sake of taking a break will actually end up with a lower loop count in the long run, if it means you’re all fresh and ready to go in the next ones.</p>
<p>I know, I know. I can’t believe <i>I’m</i> the one pulling a Gabbro right now. But I’m just saying, it really looks like you need it.</p>
</div>



<div class=shiplog_diary>
<p class=time></p>
<p>Past loop me left no catch-up notes. Hal says I died early, though they didn’t tell me how. That’s, uh… something I probably should be mindful of. Turns out there’s other ways to die in space than the sun blowing up on us, haha, who knew? Heh… ouch. Future me, remember to comfort Hal more often. That must be much tougher on them than it is on you. At least I (…we?) only get to live through it once.</p>
</div>





<div class=shiplog_diary>
<p class=time></p>
<p>Hey Hal. Or future me. Or nobody, I don’t think anyone’s reading these anymore.</p>
<p>Got any luck with Gabbro? I hope Gabbro’s not… well, <i>Gabbro</i>. Not too much. I can’t believe they managed to LOSE their ship before the loops started. They’d better figure out its exact location and find a quick way to get to it each time the universe resets.</p>
</div>




<div class=shiplog_diary>
<p class=time></p>
<p>I am. NOT opening the past entries. GEEZ there’s so many of them.</p>
<p>I mean, don’t worry Hal, I’m reading the first ones so I can get the basics without you having to tell me.</p>
<p>…Or at least I <i>would</i> be doing that if you could leave me more than five seconds in front of the computer before dragging me to the front seat and asking me to pilot, that is. You want me to go to DARK BRAMBLE of all places???</p>
<p>I hope this isn’t a loop where we’ll die horribly. I don’t want to think of how many of those you’ve been through.</p>
</div>





<div class=shiplog_diary>
<p class=time></p>
<p>Hal, I don’t know if you ever read these. Maybe you did in the earlier loops. Maybe early loops me didn’t even tell you I’d make those entries too. I mean, I’m pretty sure the original thought was mostly to keep myself up to date, which means saying a lot of things you know by heart at this point.</p>
<p>I… don’t know how reading these would make you feel. I don’t know if I’d like you to keep reading them or not. I don’t know if you should.</p>
</div>





<wip>
<p>“If I were to take your ship, how mad would you be?”</p>
<p>“…Probably way too confused to be mad. Also extremely worried.”</p>
</wip>

<wip>
<p>“Don’t worry Slate, I know what I’m doing!”</p>
<p>When Slate’s aghast and agape face had the displeasure of witnessing their latest creation disgracefully plummet right into the nearest geyser, they gained immediate confirmation that Hal, in fact, very much did not know what they were doing.</p>

PROLOGUE:
<p>“Heard me the first time.” Hal instantly prevented their fall with a swift catch under their arms, as if even the way their friend would lose their balance had been meticulously calculated, and gently but firmly guided them to the pilot’s seat, even buckling them up before they even had time to process it. “Giant’s Deep, please. Gabbro’s waiting.”</p>
<p>The brand new pilot seemed ready to protest, as they always did. Hal closed their eyes so tight that they appeared to be sinking within their deeply conflicted forehead, then gave a painful sigh.</p>
<p>“We’ll… We’ll have time to discuss properly while the autopilot does its thing. <i>Please</i>, just take off first. The sun isn’t in the way, we won’t have to watch the road all that much.”</p>
———————————————————————————————————————————————————

“Ugh… I just wish we didn’t have to rely on <i>Gabbro</i> of all people.”
“Come on, I’m sure they’ll take it seriously when they learn about what the statue did to you.” Whatever it was that the statue did to begin with.

# Possible start of loop situations: Just finished prepping the statue with Hornfels (evil). Start each loop with Hornfels saying "That should do it" and Hal taking a short breath after physical activity.

# Loop 1
## When Hal gets paired:
The next moment, they heard loud steps running straight to them.
"Hal, you alright!?"
They forced all four eyelids closed, then open, then closed and open again, hard. Their light-headed neck rotated towards the source of the sound, not unlike how the statue had done just a moment before.
It was Firn. Judging from their bewildered expression, they must have finished walking down the stairs just in time to witness the same strangeness that they just had, so...
"Did… did you see that?" they asked weakly, shakily pointing at the three golden orbs which an instant prior were shining bright, but were now extinguished.
"Yeah, the statue just rotated on its own and opened its eyes!" Rushing to them, then to the statue, their friend placed a hand on the empty eyeballs. "You think they're gonna start glowing again?" Turning again to Hal, their curious and excited smile turned upside down. "Wait, no, sorry. You don’t *look* good. It seemed like it... D-did it *do* something to you?"
Firn had described the statue's movements and the glowing. Nothing else.
"You… so you didn’t see it," Hal mumbled weakly. To be fair, they themself were not certain that they had *seen* anything else, either. Not with... not really with their own four eyes, that was. "I… I think I… saw my own memories replay before me? Backwards?"
Firn blinked in worry. "Whoa. That's..." They blinked again, fumbling onto their words, then rubbed two deadpan fingers on their forehead. "<span class=smol>Okay, yeah, that's *weird*, *obviously*. Can't find much better words.</span>" "Heh, you... think you just thought it was gonna kill you and you saw your life flashing before your eyes? Must've scared the lights out of you I bet."
That was a decent enough explanation, but... there was more to it. Hal shook their head. "No, I'm... I'm pretty sure that was different."
Firn's nervous smile faltered, letting their ears drop somewhat guiltily. "...I know, I was just kidding. And even if it was just you hallucinating, the statue still *did* do something, whatever it was. It's been on this planet for *weeks*, why's it only acting up now? Because it didn’t like being turned into a museum exhibit?" They looked Hal up and down one more time, assessing their state, before turning again to the statue. "Where did it come from again?"
Hal's hands finally managed to stop trembling. "Giant's Deep," they replied instantly. "It was Gabbro who found it."
Firn nodded. Their back was still turned to them, but they rotated their head just enough for Hal to see that they were sending them a mischievous grin. "Forget the Attlerock. I know which planet I'm crashing my ship into."

<p>Firn blinked in worry. "Whoa. That’s…" They blinked again, fumbling onto their words, then rubbed two deadpan fingers on their forehead. "<span class=smol>Okay, yeah, that’s *weird*, *obviously*. Can’t find much better words.</span>" "Heh, you… think you just thought it was gonna kill you and you saw your life flashing before your eyes? Must've scared the lights out of you I bet."</p>
But… there was more to it. Hal shook their head. "No, I’m… I’m pretty sure that was different."

<p>“Whoa, what was <i>that</i>!?”</p>
<p>“Firn?” “Did… Did you see it too?”</p>
<p>“Almost missed it, but yeah!” “That statue just moved on its own!”</p>
<p>“That’s… all you saw, then?”</p>
<p>“Weren’t its eyes <i>closed</i> before!? Did you know it could open them?”</p>
<p>“…Uh. Never mind the statue. Hal, you don’t look good.”</p>
<p>Shaken as they were, Hal knew that this was the closest they would get to Firn directly asking if they were alright. Old habits die hard.</p>


Firn looked away and up, glaring at the statue. "Well. Regardless of whether it did something to *you* specifically, it did *something* alright. And if it spooked you *that* badly…" "Eh. It's not just about solving a mystery anymore. Now it's *personal*."
Hal snickered with sincerity, albeit weakly. "You, saying you care? Wow, you're lucky nobody heard you."
They pouted with their lips pursed and cheeks slightly puffed. "I said it in a cool way. That doesn't count."

One of the loops will start with the probe hitting Firn's ship :D
"Firn, we'll need you to take us to [insert planet]."
"So, funny story..."

Hal, upon walking to the stairs at the center of the museum, has a double take when they spot something glowing in the corner of their eye: the Nomai writings on the Attlerock wall started glowing, where nobody ever saw them as anything but regular carving into stone. Hal reasons that they likely just mistook that for the light of the gravity crystal, though they are quite certain they did not get the two exhibits’ locations mixed up.

<p>Their signalscope finally decided to pick up a sound coming from the Outer Wilds Ventures frequency, and strangely, what it picked up was not music, but a voice.</p>
<p class=radio>“—cyclone just left. Look, I’ve… urgh. I’ve”</p>
