<div class=chp id=2024-quantum-exchange>
<p>It was Hornfels who gave them the warning.</p>
<p class=vs>As they ran down the path towards the launch tower, Gossan’s furrow lowered little by little with each step. Of <i>course</i>, Slate would never radio them in person, even if the sky itself were to magically ignite.</p><p>It would most likely be done under such scenario as an attempt to avoid lighting up a <i>second</i> fire in the process, and they were most likely perfectly aware that they were only delaying the inevitable, as they would get an earful anyway specifically because they did not want to give them the warning firsthand.</p>
<p>As soon as a certain campfire fell into view, however, all of their attention was drained from the face of one Hearthian, to that of another. Sobbing in the engineer’s arms sat the huddled shape of Outer Wilds Ventures’ latest recruit – Gossan’s newest and youngest trainee.</p>
<p>Slate’s nearest ear twitched and turned to them as they approached, and their eyes quickly followed. “Nightmare, I presume,” they shared quietly before Gossan could ask. “Must’ve been a pretty bad one if it left them <i>that</i> shaken.”</p>
<p class=vs>With their blood still boiling from the adrenaline of their freshly completed race, the coach found nothing to reply aside from a pair of clenching fists. A snappy remark about the source of said nightmare being <i>perchance</i> related to a certain someone’s general lack of interest in implementing safety measures died in their throat when their eyes once again fell on the quivering hatchling.</p>
<p>If Gossan didn’t know any better, they could have sworn that the astronaut was trying to escape Slate’s grasp and run as far away as possible, only to be met with limbs too frail to let them accomplish any of it, and left with the ability to grant evasion to none but their own tears.</p>
<p>But that couldn’t be right. Sure, they had never been the biggest fan of hugs; but they far more certainly had never been one to refuse them in a moment of weakness, either. They had fully and gladly returned their mentor’s embrace for a small eternity composed of naught but a bubble of silence gently wrapping a bouquet of shivering cries, after their very first attempt at jetpack training had led them straight into the core of a geyser from the south pole crater.</p>
<p class=vs>Gossan took a few steps forward, calling out to them gently—</p>
<p>From the sudden recoil and muffled scream, it appeared that the mere sound of their voice had struck them down like thunder.</p>
<p class=vs>Fighting a recoil of their own, Gossan forced their feet to instead step further forward, asking in an even softer tone – if that could be possible – what was wrong.</p>
<p class=vs>When the hatchling’s head finally turned to let them see their expression, their eyes were not only purple from crying; instead of returning Gossan’s worried look, their glassy surface seemed to be looking not <i>at</i> them, but <i>through</i> them, as if Gossan themself were equally made of glass.</p>
<p>A type of glass which had become so translucent, thin and dulled after so much repeated and repetitive polishing, that they had started to doubt whether it was even still there at all.</p>
<p class=vs>This hollow look – or <i>absence</i> of look, debatably – succeeded where their previous startle had not. Gossan froze in place, paralyzed by the amount of questions and worries that were now filling their head and spreading down their spine and through their entire body.</p>
<p>Before long, the hatchling’s head rotated back to realign itself with the axis of their shoulders – and thus, reluctantly, to also reunite with Slate’s chest. A choked mumble just barely escaped their lips, so silent that Gossan struggled greatly to reassemble it into words:</p>
<p>“…there all along… will never know… can’t bring back… wouldn’t matter…”</p>
<p>Gossan could not tell whether they were speaking as though Slate and they were supposed to know what this was supposed to be about, or whether they were entirely speaking to themself, and had indeed forgotten that anyone else around them existed.</p>
<p>Two different pairs of eyes turned to them – <i>really</i> turned to them, this time. “They’ve been babbling stuff like this since they woke up,” Slate muttered gravely. “No clue what they’re talking about, but they sure aren’t flying in this state.”</p>
<p>Again, Gossan had to bite back a comment voicing their suspicion that the engineer was more concerned about the well-being of the ship than that of the pilot. Wrong time and place. Other concerns of higher priority.</p>
<p>Other concerns such as reasoning an evidently delusional hatchling, as a somewhat louder and surprisingly more coherent string of words came out of their mouth as a direct reply to the shipwright’s latest comment: “Giant’s Deep… Let me go. I have to tell Gabbro.”</p>
<p>Slate raised a skeptical but wavering eyebrow. “Yeah, sure pal. Sorry, but that’s not happening. Maybe try to calm down first.”</p>
<p class=vs>Gossan nodded gravely, too focused on the matter at hand to realize that this was perhaps the very first time they could agree with them in years. Instead, they once again tried to get closer, and managed to crouch down to reach the hatchling at eye level. They reached forward with a comforting hand, but reconsidered when the astronaut expressed their need for boundaries with a distressed flinch.</p>
<p>Their hand went instead to rest on their lap and support their posture. “What do you want to tell Gabbro?”</p>
<p>No response. Well, it was worth a shot.</p>
<p>“If you want, we can ask Hornfels to radio them and let you have your chat. I mean– That’s where you were supposed to go get your launch codes, remember? How’d you plan to fly all the way there without them, anyway?”</p>
<p>Another shiver; but this time, this one had been fueled not by distress, but by frustration. The hatchling’s lips sharply trembled with what appeared to be patience running out; and as though Gossan’s words were supposed to be interpreted as not polite advice, but a patronizing challenge, the young astronaut’s forces came back at once, and they sprung out of Slate’s arms as fast as a cockpit ought to detach from the hull at the press of the eject button.</p>
<p class=vs>Before either founder could finish to process what had just happened and regain their senses, the young Hearthian was running for the elevator. Only Gossan’s reflexes allowed them to catch up and barely step on the platform, just as the last key of a button sequence was being pressed.</p>
<p>To their utter shock, the floor moved upwards. A split second later, the hatchling turned to them, only now noticing that their coach had unfortunately managed to make it in time, and they stepped back with a pair of cowering ears and two more of fearful eyes; but soon, the hollowness took even that away, only leaving the barebones shadow of resigned defiance.</p>
<p>Gossan was far too compassionate to be mad, far too distraught to know better than to ask, and far too confused to find the lucidity to align more than a single word: “<i>How?</i>”</p>
<p>The astronaut’s fists clenched and shook as they looked away. “Just leave me alone.”</p>
<p>The elevator would soon reach the top of the launch tower, and Gossan now knew exactly what the next sequence of actions would be once up there if they did not find a way to change their mind. They had to think of something, and fast.</p>
<p><i>“You’re in no mental state to fly, and I trust you enough to know this yourself.”</i></p>
<p class=vs>This was what Gossan would normally say. This was what they <i>should</i> have managed to word in a way such to successfully reason with them.</p>
<p>Instead of these reasonable words, once again their reflexes spoke before their mind could finish to ground them for medical reasons:</p>
<p>“I’ll get you there.”</p>
<p>Their lips quickly shut in instant regret; but when the hatchling turned their head to them in genuine surprise, it became apparent that this actually was a step in the right direction. Or at the very least, the only time any of their words had managed to take them off guard.</p>
<p>Gossan swallowed. “You’re shaking like a leaf, you know just as well as I do that you can’t fly like this,” they quickly mumbled, tensing up just as much when they glanced up. They were almost at the top. “So if you care so much about going <i>right now</i>, let me at least be the pilot.”</p>
<p>The hatchling frowned and looked away, pondering their options. The floor shook one last time as the surrounding architecture gave a final metallic clank.</p>
<p>“Fine.” The raspy croak had been just as painful to utter as it was for Gossan to hear. “But don’t ask questions.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Gossan internally thanked the solar system for being so small, and Slate’s ships for being so fast. This combination allowed for only one minute or so of awkward silence during which they were all too aware of the hatchling’s resentful glare piercing through the pilot’s seat and straight for the back of their head, and this was one minute too many.</p>
<p>They were still maneuvering through the landing when they heard the hatch open and a strict order – or was it a <i>threat?</i> – uttered through gritted teeth: “Don’t follow me.”</p>
<p class=vs>Gossan could not help but find an imaginary Slate mocking them for stickling so dutifully to safety, because the harness they had fought so hard to get implemented in every new ship had now become their worst enemy. By the time their panic allowed them to haphazardly extricate themself from the pilot’s seat and crank their neck backwards to properly call out after them, the ship had long lost its passenger.</p>
<p>Turning back ahead, their horrified eyes caught sight of a bare blue head running on the beach and through a tunnel, with as much confidence as if they knew this alien planet like the back of their hand.</p>
<p>Their <i>bare blue head</i>. That reckless idiot– They forgot to put on their suit! As grateful as Gossan was for it, this knucklehead frankly did not deserve the sheer luck the universe had given them, for this specific area to have breathable oxygen – if the fact that they had yet to suffocate and crumble to the ground was any indication.</p>
<p>Gossan considered jumping after them – but venturing outside without a suit of their own was a risk they refused to take on principle, and besides the hatchling’s clear demand, they had to admit that there would not be much point in bringing the suit to them <i>while</i> wearing that very same suit. If only this ship contained a spare.</p>
<p>Oh well. At least they were going to be with Gabbro. As aloof as they were, the astronaut <i>was</i> competent. With some more luck, they would somehow be the one to bring the hatchling back to reason. All Gossan now had to do was… wait, they supposed.</p>
<p>As they nervously paced around the ship, they caught sight of the computer flashing in response to their presence. At first merely glancing at it, they soon twitched and turned back to have a double take:</p>
<p class=vs>This was their first launch.</p>
<p class=vs>This was this <i>ship</i>’s first launch, too. Every ship computer started as a blank slate.</p>
<p>This ship’s <i>first trip</i> had barely lasted a minute, maybe two at the <i>utter</i>most.</p>
<p>It was <i>physically impossible</i> for the newest astronaut to have written in this much data in the span of <i>one minute</i>.</p>
<hr>
<p>A time loop.</p>
<p>This made no sense.</p>
<p>This made so much sense.</p>
<p>Gossan’s entire body was shaking from the amount of information they had just glazed over, at first with morbid curiosity and somewhat dreadful anticipation, then soon with growing horror and urgency.</p>
<p>Had the entire universe truly been repeating its last twenty-two minutes for– for how long? <i>Nine million</i> times!? Had these two been all too aware and trapped in this nightmare all along?!</p>
<p>They spared no thought for their quite honestly mediocre piloting this time around – even if it meant doing the exact thing they had explicitly told the newest astronaut not to just about a dozen and a half minutes ago. If all of this was true, and <i>dozens of scout photographs that should not exist</i> could not lie, then time was running out.</p>
<p class=vs>Did Gossan have a plan? Yes. No. The most rational part of their mind, the most rigid stickler for safety, screamed in the back of their head that this was a <i>terrible</i> idea. A <i>reckless</i> idea. An <i>utterly insane</i> idea.</p>
<p class=vs>Their now stolen ship was speeding through the ocean and chasing after an arched island all the same. If luck had been on their side for so long today, luck would decide whether their only chance at doing something that would <i>matter</i> was worth attempting.</p>
<p>Consequences be thrown to the bramble, they would argue with that part of their mind later. If they failed, there would not be any argument to remember having. If they succeeded, they would have all the time in the universe and more to have regrets.</p>
<p class=vs>The cockpit shook as they dipped below the surface, and shook more as they ascended again only to scrape the inner walls of what the newest recruit’s ship log had identified as a Nomai statue workshop. Ignoring the protesting beeps warning them that multiple parts of the ship had been damaged in the process, Gossan just barely remembered to borrow the already once forgotten suit before jumping down.</p>
<p>The most skeptical part of their mind, the one that had only agreed to come all this way in order to find <i>tangible proof</i> that what they had read in this computer was more than pure invention, reluctantly conceded that this whole story had better be true, because if not and Slate were to learn about all this, they would never hear the end of it.</p>
<p class=vs>Broken.</p><p class=vs>Just a rock.</p><p class=vs>That one was clearly unfinished.</p><p class=vs>Broken…? Or had they just been too trusting of a clearly delusional and now equally broken hatchling? No, that could not explain it– no astronaut had ever explored either space station orbiting the sun or Giant’s Deep, or managed to land on the Quantum Moon and taken a photo of a <i>living Nomai</i>.</p><p>Come on, there <i>had</i> to be at least one…!</p>
<p>When they were finally caught off guard by the sound of stone scraping against stone, and soon frozen as they locked eyes with <i>something</i> that soon started glowing and peering into their mind, Gossan was mere seconds away from dying in a blast of stellar fire.</p>
</div>
<div class=chp>
<p>Among the many questions, dilemmas, life choices reconsiderations, and other ponderings Gossan had deliberately pushed back for later, the first to barge in uninvited was the forced confrontation with death by supernova itself – followed by… <i>un</i>death?</p>
<p>Followed by finding themself standing in the entrance of the Zero-G cave and without a spacesuit, as they soon decided to go with. This was the factual answer. This was the answer that– best avoided the <i>philosophical</i> questions, and favored the scientific ones instead. Even though what they had read in the hatchling’s ship log was supposed to answer at least a couple of them.</p>
<p class=vs>The second train of thought soon came after, as soon as their now weirdly gone adrenaline – gone from their body, yet not quite their <i>mind</i>, this was an unusual sensation to be sure – allowed for the realization to truly sink in:</p>
<p>They were in a time loop. They were now <i>aware</i> that there was a time loop.</p>
<p>…Now what?</p>
<p class=vs>Hm.</p><p>Perhaps the first logical step would be to warn the two Hearthians they had attempted this for, starting with the one who should now be back on planet too.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, just as this thought was being formulated in their mind, it was interrupted by the distant sound of ignition; and as they rushed out of the cave to look for its source, they were granted just a few seconds before the shape of a spaceship escaped their sight, as it rapidly shrank and passed below the horizon.</p>







<wip style=display:none>



(Once Gossan is paired, in the next loop Hatchy launches and leaves the planet before they can have the time to let them know that they even got paired. They try to radio them, in vain. They will try radioing Gabbro instead, who says that, yeah, Hatchy stopped picking up their radio because of the loops, since Hornfels will always try to call them out for breaching protocol. They promise to pass the message next time Hatchy comes to see them (which is "every once in a while"). In the meantime, Gossan will try to prepare their own ship, but this may take too long...?)



(Gossan goes to the observatory to try and radio Gabbro, and they see Hornfels and Hal around the statue. When they see the open eyes, they shiver with horror and dread, now that they know what it must have been like for the hatchling.)



<!-- “They were there all along and you’ll never see them again” -->


(Gossan reading in the ship log history that the ship has gone through extensive damage and thus crashed multiple times, having reactor failures multiple times and having also recorded ghost matter warnings and “vitals critical” warnings. They confront Hatchy about it and Hatchy is on the defensive, saying that that one time it wasn’t their fault if the Interloper sniped them from behind, or that they won’t ever get to visit Ember Twin *without* the sand, or that they always get a new ship every 22min anyway... Gossan interrupts them to hug them, saying that the ship’s integrity or why they went in despite the danger was not the point. The point was that they had been put in that situation in the first place and that nobody deserves that, especially not a hatchling on what was supposed to be the day when their dream could finally come true.)



(After a certain loop, Hatchy finally reveals what happened on the loop right before Gossan was paired. Gossan, checking the ship log, already knew about the crash in Dark Bramble; but what they did not know was that Hatchy got to see Feldspar trying to revive them soon before they lost too much blood and died.)



(Hatchy was inconsolable because last loop, they awoke and tried to escape from an anglerfish, but crashed into a vine and died just as Feldspar was rushing to them and trying to mend their bleeding.)
