<div class=hudgreen><details open><summary><u><b style=font-weight:800>Main Timeline:</b> <i>Fate Knows No One</i></u></summary><ul>
    <li><i>Fate Knows No One</i> is a fanfic based on a very simple idea: Hal gets paired with the museum’s statue instead of the newest astronaut.</li>
    <li>This fanfic can be read either on this website (for the full experience), or on AO3 (still the same good read, you just don’t get to have <i>all</i> of the cool formatting effects even though honestly there isn’t <i>that</i> much of a difference in the aesthetics):</li>
    <p>» <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/works/55228189>[AO3]</a> | <a href=fkno.html>[Github]</a></p>
    <li>Also uh. The Github version <i>may</i> occasionally load with extra unfinished chapters (and thus FKNO spoilers) if I forget to remove the WIP sections from the online version. Please ignore those…?</li>
</ul></details></div>

<div class=hudgreen><details open><summary><u><b style=font-weight:800>Main Timeline:</b> FKNO Flashbacks</u></summary><ul>
    <li>Various short stories set prior to the time loop. These include:</li>
    <li><a href=fkno-past_quantum.html class=green><i>In Every State Until Observed</i>:</a> With the museum’s newest exhibit and the plaque adorning it, Hal remembers the quantum grove, and wishes Gabbro could have been taken more seriously. Firn is skeptical, but they do enjoy a little mystery.</li>
</ul></details></div>

<h1 style=font-size:2em;margin-top:1em>Worldbuilding Notes</h1>

<div class=hudblue><details open><summary><u>Hearthian Culture</u></summary><ul>
    <li><b class=blue>Time Measurements:</b> For the sake of having more elaborate plots and more time for the characters to develop (then un-develop all over again), the time loop lasts 220 human minutes instead of 22.</li>
</ul></details></div>

<h1 style=font-size:2em;margin-top:2em>“Character X Gets Stuck Inside Firn’s Ship Log” AUs</h1>
<p>In all cases, this idea stems from the fact that Firn’s ship log retains its information throughout the loops via the exact same system as any living being who was included in the Ash Twin Project. Which led to the following hypothetical question: What if a pairing goes wrong, and though the memories are successfully collected, the Ash Twin Project is somehow unable to send them to their intended owner?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, this kind of ATP shenanigans could lead to a huge range of unexpected results, notably body-swapping and whatnot. But somehow giving endless trauma to Hearthian hatchlings by turning them into ships sounded more fun.</p>
<p>I 100% blame the fanfic <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/works/52388716><i>to dream rewritten dreams</i></a> for this. If you have read it, you may find the connection. If you haven’t, go read it and you might see.</p>
<div class=huddarkorange><details open><summary><u><b style=font-weight:800>Separate Time Loop:</b> “Ship Firn AU”</u></summary><ul>
    <li>This AU would start as strictly identical to regular FKNO up until the events of Loop 9.</li>
    <li>The exact circumstances surrounding the setup are set in stone and detailed, but since they would spoil the future of FKNO… I would rather not give too many details for now hahaha.</li>
    <li>I have written a bunch of stuff for it in the form of fanfic excerpts, but I have yet to format them in a satisfying manner… and, again, spoilers for regular FKNO make me reluctant to post much about it for the time being.</li>
</ul></details></div>
<div class=huddarkorange><details open><summary><u><b style=font-weight:800>Separate Time Loop:</b> “Ship Hal AU”</u></summary><ul>
    <li>This AU branched off the Ship Firn AU, and is a little more… hand-wavey regarding how exactly it happens.</li>
    <li>It would start as strictly identical to regular FKNO up until Loop 8, during which Firn decides to tinker with the museum’s statue instead of doing what they would have normally done at this point in regular FKNO.</li>
    <li>By the magic of “Who cares about how it happens, if you’re reading this then all you are interested in is the consequences,” Firn accidentally activates the statue and causes it to pair with them as well, despite the fact that this statue was already paired with Hal.</li>
    <li>Both hatchlings immediately know that this does not bode well for the next loops, and try to mentally brace themselves for what may happen next time there is a supernova; however, Hal being removed from the Ash Twin Project while their memories are still saved, and then having said memories be sent to Firn’s ship log instead, was definitely not part of the list.</li>

<h1 style=font-size:2em;margin-top:2em>Post-Loop AUs</h1>

<div class=hudblue><details open><summary><u><b style=font-weight:800>Alternate Universe:</b> Modern AU</u></summary><ul>
    <li>This AU took inspiration from <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/works/55439206/><i>Erasure</i></a> by Fridurmus, <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/works/55412944/><i>Time Pressure</i></a> by Evalka, and the fact that the OW Discord server I hang out in a lot had a “Draw everyone in dapper suits” event going on, thus beaming into my brain dozens of images of Hearthians in fancy modern clothes.</li>
    <li>After going to the <span class=lblue>Eye</span> at the end of FKNO, Hal’s new universe is created with one last thought — the lingering regret that Hearthians were not given the chance to prosper as a species, not only due to the supernova and the heat death of the universe, but even because of the regular dangers of Timber Hearth which continuously dwindled both the population of Hearthians and the planet’s biodiversity as a whole.</li>
    <li>14.3 billion years later, the solar system has reformed in a quite similar shape to how it used to be in the previous universe, with the notable distinction that the <span class=lblue>Eye</span> is now absent. Because of this, neither the Stranger nor the Nomai ever came.</li>
    <li>Additionally, following Hal’s last regret, the “bramble” as a plant species never developed, the geysers on Timber Hearth are no longer powerful enough to send objects and people into orbit, and though the Interloper did get captured by the sun’s gravity, ghost matter no longer exists.</li>
    <li>Hearthian society has been able to develop and grow to a much larger scale than in the previous universe, with their daily lives being now close to human 21st century Western culture. The absence of Nomai ruins to explore and tinker with has ironically slowed down their spacefaring progress, and although Outer Wilds Ventures is pretty much the Hearthian equivalent of NASA, no living being has yet been sent into space (not for a lack of trying from Feldspar).</li>
    <li>Hal, after slumbering for 14.3 billion years, awakens on this new Timber Hearth, already surprised by the fact alone that they are somehow still alive. However, as they learn more about this new vastly different world, another discovery soon leaves them in shock: according to this new Hearthian society, they never existed.</li>
