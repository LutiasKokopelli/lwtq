<div class=hudgreen><details open><summary><u><b style=font-weight:800>Main Timeline:</b> <i>Fate Knows No One</i></u></summary><ul>
    <li><i>Fate Knows No One</i> is a fanfic based on a very simple idea: Hal gets paired with the museum’s statue instead of the newest astronaut.</li>
    <li>This fanfic can be read either on this website (for the full experience), or on AO3 (still the same good read, you just don’t get to have <i>all</i> of the cool formatting effects even though honestly you shouldn’t even care that much): <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/works/55228189>[AO3]</a> — <a href=fkno.html>[Github]</a></li>
</ul></details></div>

<div class=hudblue><details open><summary><u>Hearthian Culture</u></summary><ul>
    <li><a href=#int_hea_time class=blue>Time Measurements:</a> For the sake of having more elaborate plots and more time for the characters to develop (then un-develop all over again), the time loop lasts 220 human minutes instead of 22.</li>
</ul></details></div>

<h1 style=font-size:2em;margin-top:2em>“Character X Gets Stuck<br>As Firn’s Ship” AUs</h1>
<p>In all cases, this idea stems from the fact that Firn’s ship log retains its information throughout the loops via the exact same system as any living being who was paired to the Ash Twin Project. Which led to the following hypothetical question: What if a pairing goes wrong, and though the memories are successfully collected, the Ash Twin Project is somehow unable to send them to their intended owner?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, this kind of ATP shenanigans could lead to a huge range of unexpected results, notably body-swapping and whatnot. But somehow giving endless trauma to Hearthian hatchlings by turning them into ships sounded more fun.</p>
<p>I 100% blame the fanfic <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/works/52388716><i>to dream rewritten dreams</i></a> for this. If you have read it, you may find the connection. If you haven’t, go read it and you might see.</p>
<div class=huddarkorange><details open><summary><u><b style=font-weight:800>Alternate Time Loop:</b> “Ship Firn AU”</u></summary><ul>
    <li>This AU would start as strictly identical to regular FKNO up until the events of Loop 9.</li>
    <li>The exact circumstances surrounding the setup are set in stone and detailed, but since they would spoil the future of FKNO… I would rather not give too many details for now hahaha.</li>
    <li>I have written a bunch of stuff for it in the form of fanfic excerpts, but I have yet to format them in a satisfying manner… and, again, spoilers for regular FKNO make me reluctant to post much about it for the time being.</li>
</ul></details></div>
<div class=huddarkorange><details open><summary><u><b style=font-weight:800>Alternate Time Loop:</b> “Ship Hal AU”</u></summary><ul>
    <li>This AU branched off the Ship Firn AU, and is a little more… hand-wavey regarding how exactly it happens.</li>
    <li>It would start as strictly identical to regular FKNO up until approximately Loop 8, during which Firn decides to tinker with the museum’s statue instead of doing what they would have normally done at this point in regular FKNO.</li>
    <li>By the magic of “Who cares about how it happens, if you’re reading this then all you are interested in is the consequences,” Firn accidentally activates the statue and causes it to pair with them as well, despite the fact that this statue was already paired to Hal.</li>
    <li>Both hatchlings immediately know that this does not bode well for the next loops, and try to mentally brace themselves for what may happen next time there is a supernova; however, Hal being removed from the Ash Twin Project while their memories are still saved, and then having said memories be sent to Firn’s ship log instead, was definitely not part of the list.</li>

<h1 style=font-size:2em;margin-top:2em>Post-Loop AUs</h1>

<div class=hudblue><details open><summary><u><b>Alternate Universe:</b> Modern AU</u></summary><ul>
    <li>This AU was inspired from <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/works/55439206/><i>Erasure</i></a> by Fridurmus, <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/works/55412944/><i>Time Pressure</i></a> by Evalka, and the fact that the OW Discord server I hang out in a lot had a “Draw everyone in dapper suits” event going on, thus beaming into my brain dozens of images of Hearthians in modern clothes.</li>
    <li>After going to the <span class=lblue>Eye</span> at the end of FKNO, Hal’s new universe is created with one last thought — the lingering regret that Hearthians were not given the chance to prosper as a species, not only due to the supernova and the heat death of the universe, but even because of the regular dangers of Timber Hearth which continuously dwindled both the population of Hearthians and the planet’s biodiversity as a whole.</li>
    <li>14.3 billion years later, the solar system has reformed in a quite similar shape to how it used to be in the previous universe, with the notable distinction that the <span class=lblue>Eye</span> is now absent. Because of this, neither the Stranger nor the Nomai ever came.</li>
    <li>Additionally, following Hal’s last regret, the “bramble” as a plant species never developed, the geysers on Timber Hearth are no longer powerful enough to send objects and people into orbit, and though the Interloper did get captured by the sun’s gravity, ghost matter no longer exists.</li>
    <li>Hearthian society has been able to develop and grow to a much larger scale than in the previous universe, with their daily lives being now close to human 21st century Western culture. The absence of Nomai ruins to explore and tinker with has ironically slowed down their spacefaring progress, and although Outer Wilds Ventures is pretty much the Hearthian equivalent of NASA, no living being has yet been sent into space (not for a lack of trying from Feldspar).</li>
    <li>Hal, after slumbering for 14.3 billion years, awakens on this new Timber Hearth, already surprised by the fact alone that they are somehow still alive. However, as they discover this new vastly different world, another discovery soon leaves them in shock: according to this new Hearthian society, they never existed.</li>

<!-- @SFOLD — Hearthian Culture: Time Measurements -->
<div class=shiplog id=int_hea_time style=margin-top:5vw><h1><b>Hearthian Culture</b><br>Time Measurements</h1>
    <div class=shiplog>
        <h2>In-Game Observations</h2><ul>
            <li>All durations and distances are <b class=redl>multiplied by 10</b> compared to their in-game values (…let’s pretend that the rocket science still makes sense). In human units, the <b class=indigol>time loop</b> lasts <b class=greenl>3h 48min 10s</b>, with the notable detail that the OPC takes on average a minute and a half to reorient itself into a different position before it fires, and that people who are paired with statues need some time to process the memories being sent to them before they can wake up.</li>
            <li>Any location on Timber Hearth sees a <b class=indigol>sunrise</b> every <b class=greenl>1h 9min 20s</b>. Additionally, a full rotation of Timber Hearth around the sun (what we would normally call a ‘year’) lasts only <b class=greenl>41min 43s</b>. Since both durations are so short, Hearthians will not associate the words ‘year’ or ‘day’ and ‘night’ to these natural phenomena, but to more artificial constructs.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class=shiplog>
        <h2>Fanfic Extrapolations</h2><ul>
            <li>The periodicity of the Hearthian calendar is based not only on the position of the sun in the Hearthian sky, but also of the Attlerock’s. Indeed, a <b class=indigol>solar eclipse</b> occurs every <b class=greenl>29min 18s</b> on average, and the time at which the eclipse occurs relative to the village’s sky can be used as a reference. The longest cycle which can be constructed directly from this is the time between two <b class=indigol>perfect eclipse sunrises</b> (during which the Attlerock and sun rise in the sky at the same time as an eclipse), which occurs every <b class=greenl>14days 21h 4min</b> in human units.</li>
            <li>A natural day/night cycle is called a <b class=indigol>Hearthian sunrise</b>, and would be the human equivalent to an ‘hour.’ <b class=indigol>Hearthian minutes</b> and <b class=indigol>seconds</b> are respectively a 60th and 3600th of a sunrise: a <b class=indigol>Hearthian second</b> is thus a little longer than its human counterpart, and lasts about <b class=greenl>1.16s</b> in human units.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class=shiplog>
        <h2>Fanfic Headcanons</h2><ul>
            <li>A <b class=indigol>Hearthian day</b> (our equivalent to a 24h ‘day’) is made of 52 eclipses and <b class=orng>22 day/night cycles</b>, of which, on average, 11 are dedicated to sleep and 11 to waking hours. Hatchlings sleep the most, while adults will tend to be active for longer in order to help the community. In human units, a Hearthian day lasts <b class=greenl>25h 22min 44s</b>.</li>
            <li>A <b class=indigol>Hearthian week</b> starts with an <b>eclipse sunrise</b>. A week contains <b class=orng>309 sunrises</b> split into <b class=orng>14 days with one extra sunrise</b> at the end.</li>
            <li>A <b class=indigol>Hearthian year</b> is comprised of <b class=orng>22 weeks</b>, which allows for each week’s extra sunrise to make for the duration of a full Hearthian day: it thus lasts <b class=orng>309 Hearthian days</b>, or <b class=greenl>about 327 human days</b>.</li>
            <li>The <b class=redl>time loop</b> occurs between the 113th and 117th sunrises of the week, which are the 3rd and 7th sunrises of the 6th day (written respectively as 06d03s and 06d07s). If we were to roughly translate that into some sort of human calendar by squishing the timing into a 24h clock, the loop would start around “9:45AM” and end at roughly “1PM.”</li>
