<div class=chp style=padding-top:5vw><h1>Worldbuilding notes</h1><ul>
    <li>All durations and distances are <b class=redl>multiplied by 10</b> compared to their in-game values (…let’s pretend that the rocket science still makes sense). In human units, the <b class=indigol>time loop</b> lasts <b class=greenl>3h 48min 10s</b>, with the notable detail that the OPC takes on average a minute and a half to reorient itself into a different position before it fires, and that people who are paired with statues need some time to process the memories being sent to them before they can wake up.</li>
    <li>Any location on Timber Hearth sees a <b class=indigol>sunrise</b> every <b class=greenl>1h 9min 20s</b>. Additionally, a full rotation of Timber Hearth around the sun (what we would normally call a ‘year’) lasts only <b class=greenl>41min 43s</b>. Since both durations are so short, Hearthians will not associate the words ‘year’ or ‘day’ and ‘night’ to these natural phenomena, but to more artificial constructs.</li>
    <li>The periodicity of the Hearthian calendar is based not only on the position of the sun in the Hearthian sky, but also of the Attlerock’s. Indeed, a <b class=indigol>solar eclipse</b> occurs every <b class=greenl>29min 18s</b> on average, and the time at which the eclipse occurs relative to the village’s sky can be used as a reference. The longest cycle which can be constructed directly from this is the time between two <b class=indigol>perfect eclipse sunrises</b> (during which the Attlerock and sun rise in the sky at the same time as an eclipse), which occurs every <b class=greenl>14days 21h 4min</b> in human units.</li>
    <li>A natural day/night cycle is called a <b class=indigol>Hearthian sunrise</b>, and would be the human equivalent to an ‘hour.’ <b class=indigol>Hearthian minutes</b> and <b class=indigol>seconds</b> are respectively a 60th and 3600th of a sunrise: a <b class=indigol>Hearthian second</b> is thus a little longer than its human counterpart, and lasts about <b class=greenl>1.16s</b> in human units.</li>
    <li>A <b class=indigol>Hearthian day</b> (our equivalent to a 24h ‘day’) is made of 52 eclipses and <b class=orng>22 day/night cycles</b>, of which, on average, 11 are dedicated to sleep and 11 to waking hours. Hatchlings sleep the most, while adults will tend to be active for longer in order to help the community. In human units, a Hearthian day lasts <b class=greenl>25h 22min 44s</b>.</li>
    <li>A <b class=indigol>Hearthian week</b> starts with an <b>eclipse sunrise</b>. A week contains <b class=orng>309 sunrises</b> split into <b class=orng>14 days with one extra sunrise</b> at the end.</li>
    <li>A <b class=indigol>Hearthian year</b> is comprised of <b class=orng>22 weeks</b>, which allows for each week’s extra sunrise to make for the duration of a full Hearthian day: it thus lasts <b class=orng>309 Hearthian days</b>, or <b class=greenl>about 327 human days</b>.</li>
    <li>The <b class=redl>time loop</b> occurs between the 113th and 117th sunrises of the week, which are the 3rd and 7th sunrises of the 6th day (written respectively as <code>06d03s</code> and <code>06d07s</code>). If we were to roughly translate that into some sort of human calendar by squishing the timing into a 24h clock, the loop would start around “9:45AM” and end at roughly “1PM.”</li>

<!-- @SFOLD — OOO — PROLOGUE: Attempt #459 —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— -->
<div class=chp id=ch0><h1>Prologue</h1><h2>Attempt #459</h2><hr>
<p>The first thing Firn saw upon waking up was a strange flash of light coming from Giant’s Deep.</p>
<p class=vs>The second thing Firn saw as they sat up and yawned quietly was Slate, tending to the campfire and evidently planning to soon roast some marshmallows. They decided to join in, happily reaching out for their stick as the realization of just which day this was drew in.</p>
<p>It was finally their very own launch day! They were excited beyond reason, and impatient to finally board their very own ship… albeit not enough to skip breakfast. Just one last treat or two before blasting off into space would never hurt anyone, and in fact, the delay it gave them was far more merciful to the survival of their entire world than they could have ever imagined.</p>
<p>After spending a few minutes stuffing their mouth with golden delicacies and exchanging with the Hearthian on the other side of the fire some casual banter sprinkled with the occasional sarcastic joke, the third thing Firn saw was Hal jumping off the steep descent all the way down from the observatory and straight in their direction, wearing ample white clothing and holding something that looked like a helmet under their arm. Wait— was that the <span class=scaps>eva</span> from the zero-g cave?</p>
<p>Before they knew it, Hal was right by their side and fiercely grabbing their arm, pulling up.</p>
<p>“Morning sleepyhead,” they said absent-mindedly with little to no true meaning or intent behind their words, “sorry for the rough start but we’re a bit strapped for time here.”</p>
<p>“H-<span class=scaps>h</span>al? Wha–Why–How’d you get here!?”</p>
<p class=vs>Firn had so many questions, but only one of them could physically escape their lips in an intelligible manner. Truth be told, they were so confused, and just not quite completely aware enough yet, that they themselves were not really sure which one out of their already humongous and yet continuously growing pile they had managed to phrase in its entirety, or even if a single one of them had been at all.</p>
<p>As they were dragged to the lift platform, they barely had a split second to share a distressed look with a Slate who, mouth gaping wide enough to hypothetically fit at least a dozen uncooked marshmallows simultaneously, was equally too shocked to speak coherently. By the time the next fleeting moment flew by, the shipwright’s face had already disappeared from even their upper eyes’ peripheral vision.</p>
<p>“Hal, what on <i>Hearth</i> is going on!?” they finally asked the moment they found the ability to align words in a proper order, stressing each one of them with a waning confusion which was slowly growing instead into stern annoyance.</p>
<p>“Time loop,” Hal swiftly responded with practiced efficiency, while their fingers pressed in a blur the button sequence separating them from the brand new ship which had all at the same time never launched before, and yet already travelled through the entire solar system. “We’ve been through this before, you just don’t remember it.”</p>
<p>“What? Wait, how’d you know the launch codes—”</p>
<p>“<i>Time loop</i>, Firn.” The elevator stopped with a thud, and Hal immediately resumed their quick pace, completely ignoring Slate’s confused cries resonating from below. “We have barely three sunrises before the sun explodes.”</p>
<p>“Before the sun <i class=scaps>what!?</i>” Instead of an answer, Firn was unceremoniously jostled into their very own ship, losing their balance upon landing on the gravity crystal-powered floor.</p>
<p>“Heard me the first time.” Hal instantly broke their fall with a swift catch under their arms, as if even the way they were about to collapse had been meticulously calculated and practiced countless times, and they gently but firmly guided them to face a specific wall inside their ship.</p>
<p>Firn, having barely recovered their senses enough to question what a ‘time loop’ was even supposed to be and how nonsensical it should be as a concept if one were to dare pull it out of the realm of fiction, nonetheless followed their friend’s finger pointing at something close, and looked down as they saw the Outer Wilds Ventures insignia flicker into something new.</p>
<p>Their jaw dropped.</p>

<!-- @SFOLD — 001 — CHAPTER 1: Launch Day ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— -->
<div class=chp id=ch1_1><h1>Chapter 1</h1><h2>Launch Day</h2><hr>
<p class=vs>It was the third sunrise of the day when Hal was pulled out of their sleep. Letting a grunt fester and die in their throat, their first conscious thought was to make a mental note to themself that they would have to remind Marl to close the blinds before they left the cabin for their daily attempt at sneaking past Rutile and Moraine and try to get a hit or two against <i>that tree</i>.</p>
<p class=vs>Granted, it was an immutable fact that Timber Hearth’s rotation (alongside every type of rotation of every astral body in their solar system, really) was objectively forcing upon them a sunrise every sixty minutes; but it also was an immutable fact that, in spite of the too rapid celestial dance of the star they were orbiting, there surely had to be a <i>reason</i> why their ancestors had evolved to require a minimum of six or seven sunrises of good sleep in a row.</p><p>Some had even theorized that this reason might be related to the fact that this amount of time was the average required in order to maintain the level of intelligence that their species had managed to reach, and Firn had… perhaps, sometimes, unkindly made sarcastic barbs about Marl and waking up early when they too were paying the price of the lumberjack’s disregard for others’ sleeping schedules.</p>
<p>Oh well. They were up now, four eyes bathing in undesired sunlight, and they might as well make some use of these unexpected extra forty minutes or so that the sun had so graciously forced into their hands.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal was almost surprised to not hear Firn complain about the blinds being left open as well, but then they remembered: this night, their cabin had sheltered one less Hearthian than usual.</p>
<p>Today was Firn’s launch day. How could they forget that this was the day their best friend would finally fulfill their lifelong dream?</p>
<p>Hal wondered whether they had a good night. Sleeping under the stars surely wasn’t by a long shot the most comfortable way to have a good rest, for more reasons than one. The founders of Outer Wilds Ventures and Firn themself said that it was a tradition, but they wondered whether it was a good tradition to have their astronauts depart in a state when they were bound to be in less than optimal shape.</p>
<p>They remembered Firn’s first attempt at using a jetpack. They tried not to think about Firn’s ship crashing the same way, but with even more power and momentum. Their attempt was unsuccessful.</p>
<p class=vs>…No, they needed to have more faith in them. Firn <i>had</i> passed the tests, they <i>had</i> convinced Gossan that they were ready, Gossan had even come to tell them in person that Firn was ready and that there was no need to make themself needlessly nauseous with worry about it, and among the founders, Gossan was the biggest stickler for safety.</p>
<p>Firn was going to be <i>fine</i>.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But what if they <i>weren’t?</i></p>
<hr>
<p>About twelve minutes past the sunrise, and Hal was stepping outside, taking in the scent of pine trees and the sight of a village much calmer than they were used to.</p>
<p class=vs>Part of them considered seeing for themself how Firn was doing, but they instantly reconsidered. They knew they would come to bid their goodbyes once they were ready, and from what Hal had been told, Firn would have to traverse the crater and visit Hornfels before their departure. Under these circumstances, making their way to the observatory and waiting for them up there thus sounded like the most convenient plan.</p>
<p>That being said, it wasn’t long before their train of thought had to be interrupted.</p>
<p>“If it isn’t the little Hal!” Gneiss called out with a smile. “Out early today?”</p>
<p>The hatchling rolled their eyes. “Marl forgot to close the blinds. Again. I just thought I’d try getting out of bed, for a change.” A nervous flick of their ears punctuated their frown as they soon added: “Also, I’m not <i>little</i>–”</p>
<p>Gneiss gave a soft, warm laugh. “Well, maybe some day you and Firn will finally adapt to waking up at adult times, and I’ll then start considering you like one. Any elder will tell you that the village needs more hands, and the earlier they are fresh and ready to get the job done, the better.”</p>
<p class=vs>Hal hummed, looking down. Both Firn and they were now considered in age to drink sap wine, even though they had only grown enough to stomach it four weeks ago (and even though, out of the two, either Firn was still struggling with digesting it, or they simply hated the taste). However, with this ritual of adulthood came not just the slow and progressive shedding of a nickname, but also new responsibilities in regards to sustaining the village’s comfort and lifestyle. And as much as they wanted to contribute, Hal was not quite certain how ready for it they were just yet.</p>
<p>They had the Nomai and their many years of hard work poured into deciphering their language, and they would gladly continue doing so their entire life if they could; this was the sort of path that someone like Riebeck had chosen, in a way. But… aside from giving Slate some extremely vague hints about the purpose of this or that rock and then seeing them recycle eons old debris into exploding contraptions, their research simply did not… <i>feel</i> directly useful or special. Not when their village had so many mouths to feed, and not enough hands to gather the food.</p>
<p>And so, albeit reluctantly, Hal wanted to be a part of the village proper. It was not so much about making a difference… More so about simply looking out for each other, and showing their care for the crater as a whole. It was a sense of duty. Gabbro went to space, Riebeck went to space, Firn was about to go to space… <i>Someone</i> needed to stay down here and keep the village alive, even if it meant that they could not afford to spend all of their waking sunrises figuring out more about the Nomai. It wasn’t like they even cared about space, anyway.</p>
<p>“Speaking of, while you’re here,” Gneiss continued, and Hal startled as they wondered whether they might have been dozing off, “I’ve seen you having fun with your whittling lately, and I thought I might ask for your help with a little something.”</p>
<p>Hal blinked, ears perking up. “Oh, of course,” they nodded reflexively.</p>
<p>“Agreeing before I even told you what it was?” the elder chuckled, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>They shrugged, also smiling along. “I mean, if you ask for my help, I guess it’s going to be something I <i>can</i> do, right? And aside from waiting for the next sunrise, well…”</p>
<p>There came another deep and warm chuckle. “You are such a sweet one. Firn should have tried to learn a little bit of that from you.”</p>
<p>“F-<span class=scaps>f</span>irn can be nice,” Hal retorted defensively as they followed the elder inside their cabin and to the workshop. “They’re just… blunt.”</p>
<hr>
<p class=vs>Gneiss had been working on a new fishing rod. As it turned out, Spinel’s last big catch had done quite a number on their favorite one, and despite the fact that they did have spares, it was undeniable that their efficiency had been lacking during the past few days.</p>
<p>Hal had only been enlisted for the finishing, most delicate touches; with the elder sitting by their side and blowing on the last spots of fresh varnish which still remained on the head of their latest unfinished instrument, the sunrise flew by and sunset came without either of them noticing.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal did not mind. This was by no means an activity they would call nearly as enthralling as diving their head in copies and photos of Nomai writings and trying to make any kind of sense from it all, but this was calming; stimulating enough that they would feel engaged in their work, easy and repetitive enough that they could let their mind wander without causing any mistakes. It was… pleasant enough. And the result was going to be useful, so hey, that part felt good.</p>
<p>And, well, anyway, they knew that nothing in their entire life would ever top the sheer excitement and joy that they had experienced during those long, yet far too short months spent on building the translator with their best friend. They already knew that the happiest days of their life were now likely behind them.</p>
<p>They heaved another sigh. <i>Stars</i>, they would miss them.</p>
<p>…Their mind wandered back to reality when they found Gneiss’ hand coming to them and asking for the fishing rod. Apparently, they had judged that they were done adjusting the guide rings…? Hal was not sure they were attached quite well enough, but with a shrug, they hesitantly complied.</p>
<p>“Your help truly is appreciated,” the elder hummed with a soft smile, putting the nearly-but-not-quite finished banjo away. As they did so, they gave a melancholic sigh to a different incomplete craft of theirs, which had been sitting in the same shadowed corner of their workshop for the past few days. “Alas, I was hoping to finish Firn’s instrument before their launch, but I was caught by all those impromptu delays.”</p>
<p>Hal looked down. “Sorry, if I’d known, I would’ve—”</p>
<p>Gneiss exploded in gentle laughter. “Hatchling, I just <i>thanked</i> you for your help! Whatever do you feel the need to <i>apologize</i> for?”</p>
<p>Hal stifled a laugh as well, only letting one short breath come out of their nose as a shy smile took shape in the corner of their lips. “Just a force of habit,” they shrugged.</p>
<p>Gneiss shook their head, looking up at the ceiling with a caring but exasperated sigh. They soon turned their four tired eyes to the hatchling’s work, studying the details of the carving and mounting alike, and smiling with pride while they tested the tool’s durability.</p>
<p>“I know you are far more interested in diving your head in books that were written before our species was even born,” (Hal decided against telling them that, as far as they and everyone else knew, the Nomai didn’t <i>have</i> books per se, just weird magical stones with information somehow directly imprinted into them), “but I’ve seen how delicate you are with your own crafts.”</p>
<p>Hal frowned upon seeing that the elder was no longer looking at them or the fishing rod, and frowned deeper when they followed their gaze and realized what their attention had turned to instead. Their ears gained some light shades of purple as they opened their satchel and took out their latest work in progress… one which, well, they had barely gotten started on the day before, during their last sunrise before sleep.</p>
<p>“What, this? It’s just a stick I picked up and started carving when I was bored.” It did not even look like anything yet, just like a stick with a barely pointed end. It could just as well be used as a bland stake to pitch a tent or grill a fish.</p>
<p>Gneiss stifled a laugh, deciding against pointing out all the other far more elaborate sculptures they had seen in their hands during the past few weeks, and which they were certain were hiding inside this very same satchel in this very moment.</p>
<p>“And the care you put into it would go quite well into helping the village with shiny new tools, if you wanted me to teach you the ropes. My hands aren’t as steady as they used to be, you know, so your talent truly could be put to good use.”</p>
<p>“Heh, thanks… I guess. All of them still need a lot more work, though–”</p>
<p>“Balderdash,” the elder huffed softly, “you worry too much. You’ve got a whole life ahead of you to keep learning.”</p>
<p>“And they’re not particularly useful for the village, they’re just little unfinished trinkets to keep my hands busy—”</p>
<p>“<i>Come now</i>, hatchling,” Gneiss scolded, “you know that isn’t true. You think my instruments are any more useful to the village?”</p>
<p>“At least your instruments bring everyone together during the campfires,” Hal shrugged.</p>
<p>The elder’s gaze deflated in patient and quiet exasperation. “<span class=grey><i>Sigh…</i></span> Whatever are we going to do with you if you keep putting yourself down like that? It’s like if you’re ruining your self-confidence on purpose.”</p>
<p class=vs>Everybody knew Hal could do a lot of great things, with some more polishing that would naturally come with gaining the experience of age. Everybody, except the Hearthian themself.</p>
<p>And for this, Gneiss decided to stop fooling around. “Just show me one of these from up close. If you want criticism this badly, I’ll tell you how much better than you think they truly are. I know you’ve got a couple on hand.”</p>
<p>Ears dropping, Hal took a shy step back. “B-but…”</p>
<p>“Don’t make me pull them out of your bag myself, <i>hatchling</i>,” the instrument maker threatened with a heavy and deliberate emphasis on the infantilizing designation, and Hal cowered a little more with a tiny, barely audible yelp. Those eyes did not look like they were bluffing.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, the young Hearthian opened their satchel again, searching for the least ugly one they could find, and cringing at the sight. Who were they kidding, they were <i>all</i> ugly, the anatomy was all wrong and they could never get the neck right.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, Gneiss did not seem to give a single care in the world for that. “You have quite the wild imagination,” they chuckled softly as they let the wood shine under the sunlight phasing through the pine trees. “I’ve seen you carve quite a lot of these lately.”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah, that was when Gabbro came back with a new finding, a few weeks ago… It was a statue– a <i>complete</i>, intact statue!”</p>
<p>The elder hummed. “A statue made by those… kodai, was it?”</p>
<p>“Nomai,” Hal corrected with a sheepish smile. “I just… all my life, I’ve been trying to imagine what they could <i>look</i> like, and then they made <i>that</i> huge discovery. It just makes me wish even more that I could see a real, live one, but… Well, th-that’s just wishful thinking.”</p>
<p>Seeing their fiddling hands and nervous twitching, Gneiss finally caved in and handed them the little sculpture back. Hal, blushing even more than before, seized it hurriedly and buried it back where it had come from with both haste and, somehow, still delicate care to ensure that it would not be damaged in the process.</p>
<p>“Hornfels told me yesterday that they were almost done prepping it for display,” Hal mumbled. “The– the <i>statue</i>, I mean. Should’ve said that first. Uh, I mean, m-maybe they need help with the final touches, or…” Or maybe they were already done with it by now, it was likely even, but they were not going to mention this out loud when they had finally found a way out.</p>
<p>The elder nodded with a tired chuckle, catching on their attempt at a cop out and choosing to play along. “Well, in that case I won’t hold you back any longer. You can send them my regards.”</p>
<p>With a sheepish and strained nod, the young Hearthian twiddled with the latch of their satchel and turned around mechanically, before trotting away.</p>
<p class=vs>Gneiss sighed. They would come around eventually, they told themself. They had a lot of potential, if only they could be convinced of it and accept that <i>potential</i> did not mean instant perfection. One day, they would realize that experience did not have to be gained instantly and that the only expectations they were currently disappointing were their own.</p>
<p>Hopefully.</p>
<hr>
<p>It was already well past sunset when Hal started climbing up the stairs to the observatory, and they were half cursing the elder for having taken so much of their time giving unwanted attention to their unfinished meaningless works, half berating themself for being rude about it when Gneiss had, all in all, been nothing but nice to them. Mostly.</p>
<p>As they reached the fenced patch of ghost matter and looked to the left, their ears perked up in surprise. If there was one Hearthian they had not expected to see at such high altitude, it would be none other than their older cabinmate.</p>
<p>“Marl?” they called out. “What are you doing up here?”</p>
<p>The swing of an ax was swiftly interrupted, ending craftily hidden behind the lumberjack’s back instead of between two grooves on the trunk. “Oh– Hey, Hal, good morning. Early riser much, today?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, all thanks to you,” they replied with a huff, rolling their eyes. “You forgot the blinds again.”</p>
<p>The taller Hearthian blinked in surprise. Then they brought a hand to their neck, pursing their lips. “Ooh… yeah. My bad.” They paused for a second, then tried to save face: “But you <i>know</i> I have to raise them during the night! Can’t look outside and make sure the road is clear if they’re in the way.”</p>
<p class=vs>Deciding that they would ignore any and all discussions about their increasingly convoluted schemes, Hal squinted, studying the shape of the wood from afar despite the low visibility. They only saw one or two haphazard marks, not nearly deep enough to cause any trouble, perhaps even shallow enough to avoid being noticed. Good.</p>
<p>It was in fact rather intriguing, just how little damage was made. Either Marl had been surprisingly holding back (unlikely), or this specific tree truly was noticeably sturdier than any other (much more likely). Maybe the tree did hold a grudge just as much as Marl did, somehow.</p>
<p>Hal internally snickered at the thought. As if a <i>tree</i> could maintain a feud. “And has it ever occurred to you to just… You know, let it go? Cutting down that tree will cause far more harm than good. You know Rutile means it when they try to tell you that.”</p>
<p>“And Rutile only says that because they can’t stand change. They can’t imagine how good a big tree-less crater would be! Less shade, more sun, a lot more wood. What’s not to love about that?”</p>
<p class=vs>Unfortunately for their ears and sanity, Hal had long given up on trying to bring up the argument that cutting down such a large tree was bound to cause a lot of panic and destruction once its massive trunk would fall upon at least a good half of the village’s cabins.</p>
<p>It did not mean that Marl had failed to notice that the thought had again crossed their mind and simply refused to leave their lips, though.</p>
<p>“I know what you’re thinking,” they mumbled, “and you know what? That’s the <i>point</i>. You do realize that this tree keeps growing, right? Each day that passes, it becomes an even bigger hazard. I’d be doing everyone a <i>favor</i> by getting rid of it as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“Go tell that to Rutile,” Hal sighed while rubbing their lower eyes and glaring with the other pair. “I’m not getting involved in this.”</p>
<p class=vs>“I gave the whole thing some <i>thought</i>, you know,” Marl continued anyway. “You all make a fair point about it being dangerous to try getting rid of the whole tree at once. <i>Buuut</i>, have you considered the alternative? What if I got rid of it <i>little by little</i>, starting from the top.” The ax came out of their back and was sent straight into the tree, accompanied with a grunting <i>oomph</i>; if this newest attempt had left a dent on its surface, Hal failed to find it.</p>
<p>Then, turning once again to their cabinmate as they readied another swing, they concluded with a proud grin: “Sounds much safer now, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>Hal deadpanned. “Marl. Go home before I send Moraine after you.”</p>
<p>The lumberjack pouted, but begrudgingly retracted the ax from the trunk and attached it to their belt before they crossed their arms. Walking away, they grumbled something about <i>thinking that they’d said they wouldn’t get involved</i> and that <i>they were no fun</i>.</p>
<p>“And don’t forget the <i>blinds</i>, next time!” Hal warned with a hand curled up around their mouth to let the sound of their voice reach its target.</p>
<p>As they watched them stomp their way down the mountain road and back to the village below, Hal’s ears caught the sound of laughter coming from behind.</p>
<p>“They’ll never change, will they?”</p>
<p>Hal looked up the path they had intended to take up to the observatory, and found that Gossan was currently walking down from it, having likely witnessed the scene from afar on their way. The flight coach sent them a friendly wave right after their quip, and with a small tired smile, Hal waved back.</p>
<p>“Never mind them,” the hatchling sighed. “You know they’ll be right back at it before the next sunrise.”</p>
<p>There was another amused chuckle as the elder crossed their arms and looked down; but soon, they turned their attention back to the Hearthian next to them, and studied them up and down. “So, today’s the day, huh?” they started as a non-sequitur, yet fully expecting Hal to know exactly what they were talking about. “Not too nervous?”</p>
<p>Hal did not need any reminder as they grew a worried smile. “W-well, I’m not the one going in space,” they shrugged awkwardly. They could not prevent a hand from trying to rub away the tension in their neck, and Gossan’s gaze softened upon noticing.</p>
<p>“Don’t you worry, Hal. I told you countless times, Firn is ready.”</p>
<p>They closed their eyes and heaved a long, pained breath which might as well have been a muffled scream. “<i>I know</i>. But still, I just can’t stop imagining all kinds of things that could happen to them, and they have a tendency to be <i>careless</i>, and…”</p>
<p>Gossan let them trail off in silence, lost in thought. After a short moment, they closed their eyes as well, head lowering ever so slightly. “Just like our first astronaut was,” they said with solemnity and a distinct restraint in the display of their emotions.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal gave these words all they could, in the form of a respectful moment of silence.</p>
<p>It was not a warning; it was not a wish, nor a wish that things could be different. It was simply a statement.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the sky, in the perfect silence brought by the distance and emptiness, an explosion occurred. Neither Hearthian took notice.</p>
<p>“I don’t want Firn to…” Hal caught themselves and bit their lip before they could finish that train of thought. “Sorry. I shouldn’t be saying that.”</p>
<p>The flight coach regained their smile, bittersweet. “You are a great friend, Hal. Firn will miss you as much as you’ll miss them. It’s just that… Well. You know where their eyes have always been.” Their head turned upwards, watching as Giant’s Deep was slowly leaving the zenith.</p>
<p>Hal nodded sadly, following the founder’s gaze. “The stars.”</p>
<p>“Just like Feldspar,” Gossan sighed with the same expression, of both regret and longing. “You just couldn’t keep either of them on this rock for long. Their dreams belong out there, and they’ll never stop chasing them.”</p>
<p>Silence fell again, as for a few moments, the conversation was only being maintained by the hiding crickets. The night sky was pretty.</p>
<p>A deep breath. “I made them promise they wouldn’t be trying any crazy stunts,” Hal mumbled.</p>
<p>Gossan laughed softly. “Then that’s one more reason I trust they won’t, not unless their life depended on it,” they assured– only to notice that the second part of their sentence made the hatchling’s ears flicker in fear. “…By which I mean they are going to be <i>cautious</i> on their first launch, Hal. It’s not as if they were going to try landing on that contraption orbiting the sun. Their first destination is going to be a safe one.”</p>
<p>With yet another sigh, they nodded in silence; convinced, yet not at all reassured.</p>
<p>“Tell you what,” Gossan chuckled again with more enthusiasm, “Tektite told me yesterday that a piece of mining equipment broke in the zero-g cave. I was considering asking Firn to take care of it, as a last-minute refresher. Should convince you that <i>even</i> if they ever get their ship in trouble, they’ll know how to handle it just fine.”</p>
<p>All of the hatchling’s four eyes perked up, as they shifted down to meet Gossan’s face. “You would do that?”</p>
<p>The founder raised their helmet to return their gaze with mischief. “You’re looking at me as if I’d broken that machine on purpose,” they barked in laughter. “It just happens to be a lucky opportunity. I’ll go wait for them here, they better say their goodbyes when they pass by.” And with another knowing look, they specified with fondness: “To the both of us.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Somehow, by some miracle, Hal reached the observatory before the end of the night, having encountered no other obstacle.</p>
<p class=vs>Just from approaching the entrance to the museum, their eyes widened. Hornfels had warned them that they would be done prepping the statue today; but seeing it for themself, no longer within a dusty crate in the backroom, but as a fully fledged exhibit highlighting all its splendor and majesty, made their heart flutter with excitement.</p>
<p>The Nomai statue was towering far above them, and Hal would not have had it any other way. Or, well, perhaps they could have had it <i>just</i> a little lower so it could be easier to study its shapes for their attempts at whittling them into little sticks, but– the thought was still there. This statue radiated the eons of hidden History it possessed, and Hal had nothing but deep reverence for everything it was embodying. Hornfels truly had found the best way to give this masterpiece the respect it deserved.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Hearthian, Hornfels was standing just behind the statue, dusting their hands with a massive grin on their face, admiring from the other side a completed work well done.</p>
<p>They called out happily, and the curator instantly perked up at the sound of their voice. “Hal! Why, good morning! Your timing could not be more fortunate, I’d just asked Gossan earlier to go look for you– This statue is finally ready for display!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I can see that!” the hatchling squealed in turn, completely ignoring the other remark about the flight coach they had run into on their way, too busy counting the stars of wonder which shone out of their eyes. “You did an amazing job, it looks <i>fantastic</i>.”</p>
<p class=vs>Long ago, Firn, and then later Riebeck, had asked them why they were not wishing to apply for the Outer Wilds Ventures training, if they were this fascinated by the Nomai. But Hal did not care about space, they could leave the thrill and motion sickness to those who sought it.</p>
<p>They were excited, yes, but they were also patient; and as such, they were quite content to make do with what those who had opted for exploration would bring back home. Who needed to chase the stars out there in the sky, when they could be brought down here, right into their palms and surrounded by all the tools they needed to study them? If they’d ever feel the urge to go to space, it would only be for the sake of the Nomai, not for space itself. Riebeck surely could relate with that feeling, they simply had found in themself the decisiveness to actually go through with it.</p>
<p>Looking up with a similar expression, Hornfels breathed in satisfaction; then, reluctantly, they detached their eyes from the sight and turned them to the youth by their side. “Ah… It pains me to leave this statue, but I do have a first launch to supervise,” they announced with a teasing wink.</p>
<p>Hal sent them a smile, trying to tame their worry. “Is the weather going to be okay?”</p>
<p>“It has been all day yesterday and up until the first sunrise this morning,” they assured confidently. “I will ensure nothing has changed, but I trust you have seen the sky yourself: not a cloud in sight. The flight conditions could hardly be any more ideal for takeoff.”</p>
<p>Hal gave a nod, confirming that they had seen as much.</p>
<p>“I’ll be upstairs,” the founder announced happily. “You can tell Firn to go find me once they arrive. Have fun admiring the statue in my stead!”</p>
<p>After these last words, Hal burst into honest laughter. They would do that <i>all day</i> if they could.</p>
<hr>
<p>Even the sound of footsteps resonating on the same planks of wood they were standing on failed to pull Hal out of their reverie. Instead, as those footsteps quietened all the while sneaking dangerously closer, what brought them back to reality with the subtlety of a cold bucket of water was the discomfort of someone blowing a small but perfectly aimed puff of air right into their ear.</p>
<p>Jumping almost a full meter above the ground (maybe the Attlerock was passing by and its tidal pull helped a little bit), Hal squeaked while plastering a hand against it and turning towards the source of this assault; then, as soon as they identified the risk, their face melted into laughter. “Firn, how <i>old</i> are you to still make these jokes?”</p>
<p>Ignoring their question, the newcomer crossed their arms with mock jealousy. “I see you’ve found a new best friend to replace me while I’m gone,” they teased with a toothy grin.</p>
<p>From anyone else, such remark would have been met with flushed cheeks and fumbling apologies. From Firn, though, Hal had long learned to reply with a roll of their lower eyes and a half-amused, half-annoyed snicker.</p>
<p>“It <i>is</i> beautiful, though, don’t you think?” they sighed dreamily as they once again turned to it. “Can you realize that we can finally have an idea what the Nomai used to look like? And– I’m still not over it even if I’ve seen it weeks ago, but do you see all that fur? <i>Silkmoths</i> have fur! That’s so weird!”</p>
<p>“You think they had a larval stage too?” Firn laughed, finding the sight quite hard to imagine, yet willing to indulge in it just for the sake of being able to call the mental image funny.</p>
<p>“We have yet to see any of their writings describe anything of the sort,” Hal shrugged. “But who knows, maybe you will once you’re out there.” Marking a pause, they blinked in sudden recollection and studied their friend up and down, evidently searching for an item in particular. “Speaking of, where’s the translator? Did you have someone prep it inside your ship already?”</p>
<p>With a smirk, Firn reached into their back, pulled out of their belt the tool in question, and made its tiny, thin and light shape whirl between their fingers for a full rotation or two before they grabbed its handle and held it firmly.</p>
<p>This latest stunt wrested an anxious hiss and two pairs of bulging eyes out of Hal, who just barely calmed down upon seeing a second later that everything was in control. They still bit their lip and frowned. “I-it’s <i>fragile</i>, Firn! <i>Please</i> don’t handle it like that. Geez– If you <i>break</i> it, I swear I’ll…”</p>
<p>For the first time this morning, the cadet’s smug expression softened ever so slightly. “Hey, relax, I’m gonna protect it with my <i>life</i>,” they said instantly with determination, and Hal knew they were being sincere. It was almost a shame that the smug grin instantly came back: “I mean, you’re not the only one who’s spent months of your life perfecting it, you know. I don’t want to see all that hard work go to waste either.”</p>
<p>They were met with a deadpan look. Firn be thrown into the depths of Dark Bramble if they so much as let any genuine kindness whatsoever be seen by others for more than <i>five seconds</i>. It was no wonder most people were so easily fed up with them.</p>
<p>“You’re insufferable.”</p>
<p>“And owning it with pride.”</p>
<p>They really would never change, would they? It somehow was this constant blend of masquerades and incongruous sincerity that Hal could never understand, and yet found so fascinating. Firn knew that they were one of the few who could see through their jokes, and… In a way, that made Hal feel special in their eyes. Firn had never called anyone else their best friend, and Hal could hardly imagine the prospect that they ever would.</p>
<p>Hal sighed, eyes going back and forth between their friend and the statue. “So, any plans while you’re out there?”</p>
<p>Firn pouted, looking at the ceiling and shrugging with a disinterested tilt of their head. “Ehh, I think I’ll start small with the Attlerock. I’m still not sure how safe those retro-rockets are,” and their expression had already turned into closed smug eyes and a cocky smile. Opening their upper eyes again, then their lower ones, they dared shed their brashness, and instead let their genuine excitement shine as they whispered and exclaimed at the same time: “Besides, I bet you’re <i>dying</i> to know what kind of device the Nomai were calibrating there! I know <i>I</i> am.”</p>
<p class=vs>Hal’s eyes lit up just as much at the sound of these words. Years ago, Feldspar had brought back from their first successful expedition a wall with the very first Nomai writings to be found in outer space; the very same wall that had given both them and Firn a wave of wonder and awe, and the determination to one day decipher its secrets.</p>
<p>The idea that on this very day, Outer Wilds Ventures would finally get to find out what these Cassava and Filix were talking about… Oh, they were so excited that it made them feel nauseous.</p>
<p>“Anyway,” Firn concluded with their usual detached and smug tone, “it’s not that I don’t like your company, but I’ve got some launch codes to fetch. Can’t figure out the secrets of the Nomai if I don’t get off this rock first.”</p>
<p>With a sad blink, Hal’s smile turned bittersweet. “Right. Almost forgot you had to go.”</p>
<p>Tentatively, with pleading eyes, they dared raise their hands and ask for one last hug. Firn pursed their lips, looking around their surroundings nervously, before stepping forward and accepting it.</p>
<p>For what had to be the sixth time or so, Hal rolled their eyes. “<i>Relax</i>, burnt mallow, nobody’s watching. Your reputation isn’t gonna crumble just by letting <i>some</i> caramel ooze out instead of carcinogens when you bid your heartfelt goodbyes.”</p>
<p>“Tsh. And you say <i>I’m</i> insufferable,” the cadet snickered; but their embrace tightened, and for but a short second, there was one small insistent shake of their arms as they squeezed tighter still.</p>
<p>Both childhood friends remained like this in silence, taking in their last moments together; but alas, this magical moment could not last forever.</p>
<p>Pulling out of their embrace and sharing one last fond glance with all four eyes, Firn’s smile softened. “Hey. If you ever miss me, you know you can just go ask Hornfels to radio me, I’m sure they won’t mind. I promise I’ll pick up. I’ll try to keep you updated on what I find on the Attlerock ruins, too, in real time! …Assuming I’m not too busy jumping around and having fun with the low gravity.”</p>
<p>Closing their eyes and shaking their head, Hal crossed their arms and smiled. “Yep. Insufferable.” With one last look, they sighed deeply, before concluding with a twinge of regret they tried their best to stifle: “Go on, don’t let me hold you back. Just make sure to take care of yourself, you hear?”</p>
<p class=vs>As sole answer, they received a single, tiny but sincere nod. With one last shared wave, Hal watched as their best friend walked out of the room and up the stairs to the observatory. They took a few steps forward, only stopping at the edge of the door leading to the rest of the museum’s exhibits, and their eyes followed from a distance until the ceiling hid them from view. And then… only then did the realization truly hit.</p>
<p>In this instant, for the first time in their life, Hal felt loneliness; and with it, there came a pang in their stomach as a feeling of inexplicable dread grew in their heart: the feeling that it would be a long, long time, until they would ever truly see them again.</p>
<p>Far was it from their mind to know just how true both of these statements were going to become.</p>
<hr>
<p class=vs>Thinking that Firn would have to step down those very same stairs anyway in order to walk out of the museum and reach the launch tower, Hal had decided to stay right where they were, and to go back to admiring the statue.</p>
<p>No matter how many times they looked, they could never get tired of the sight; every new second of observation seemed to reveal yet another detail they had missed before.</p>
<p class=vs>With a hand to their satchel, they plunged their fingers inside and felt the carved wood of their previous ongoing attempts at trying to recreate it. They couldn’t help it, perhaps they were indeed obsessed with this statue, almost as much as Hornfels was.</p>
<p>Looking down, they pulled out the stick they had picked up on the evening before. If they were going to wait for their friend’s return, they might as well busy their hands with something in the meantime.</p>
<p class=vs>Their knife started digging into the wood, but then they stopped and frowned.</p>
<p>Right. It simply wouldn’t do to proceed with the whittling here, they’d be getting sawdust all over the place. It hadn’t been much of an issue before in the workshop since it already was a mess anyway, but this was a <i>museum</i>, and Dark Bramble take them if they would be even the <i>last</i> Hearthian to dare soil this room.</p>
<p>Raising one last glance at the statue, they tried to memorize its shape as best they could, then lowered their gaze towards the exit and went on their way; not suspecting a single second that a long-awaited discovery from the furthest reaches of their solar system was about to be made, and that in less than a minute, its image would be indelibly carved not on wood, but directly into their own mind.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal was just passing by the exhibit when their ears caught the clang at the start of a mechanical whirr– or rather, of the gritting and inexplicable sound of stone scraping against stone.</p>
<p>Jumping in surprise, they tilted their head around and looked over their shoulder, then spun their entire body and opened their mouth, ready to scream—</p>
<p>The statue opened its eyes.</p>
</div>

<!-- @SFOLD — 001 — CHAPTER 2: 9,318,054 ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— -->
<div class=chp id=ch2_1><h1>Chapter 2</h1><h2>9,318,054</h2><hr>
<p>As much as all the intricacies of the Nomai’s greatest technological achievement had attempted to take such basic parameters into account, the process of pairing with a statue had never been expected to be a particularly enjoyable experience.</p>
<p class=vs>In this regard, never had Phlox or Daz ever intended to imply or pretend the opposite — provided, alas, they could ever be given the chance to be inquired about it.</p>
<p>Had the circumstances been any different, both would have graciously shared the forewarning with any Nomai, or even any other lifeform who might end up involved in their project, willingly or otherwise; and naturally, they would have put in all the necessary hard work to ensure that the latter case would be a risk fully secured into the realm of impossibility.</p>
<p>After all, it simply was a well-known fact, or at the very least a quite intuitively conceivable one, that nature had never felt the need to prepare any species in the entire universe for the eventuality that a living, conscious observer’s brain, would one day be asked to share with an alien contraption the surprisingly immense amount of information and cerebral stimuli that could be amassed and recorded during the past thirty-two minutes of a regular Hearthian’s casual morning, and to then process it all over again in reverse within the span of no more than three seconds and seventy-eight hundredths.</p>
<p>Adding to this the additional margins of error brought upon by the subtle differences in biology which could only be expected of two species with vastly diverging anatomies and metabolisms who originated from two respectively foreign star systems, as well as the entire multi-planet-scale device’s old age in spite of its remarkably close to intact state of preservation… It was not particularly difficult to come to a very simple conclusion:</p>
<p>Hal’s next three seconds and seventy-eight hundredths following the exact moment of the statue’s eyes opening were far from pleasant.</p>
<p>Linguist as they were, Hal found themself unable to find words to describe whatever had just transpired in the confines of their mind; though, admittedly, this predicament may have been related to the fact that for the next few instants, they found themself already busy attempting to remember how to comprehend an abstract and artificial concept as profoundly complex and unintuitive as recognizing up from down.</p>
<p>The next moment, they heard loud steps running in their direction. Every ounce of intelligence and awareness they had been gifted at birth and proceeded to actively nurture ever since came back in a flash — including the now inherent knowledge that, a few seconds ago, those footsteps had been running <i>down</i>wards, and had therefore at some prior point originated from <i>up</i>wards. Upstairs, even.</p>
<p>“Hal, are you alright!?”</p>
<p>Hal forced all four eyelids closed, then open, then closed and open again, <i>hard</i>. Their light-headed neck rotated towards the source of this panicked sound, not unlike how the statue had done just a moment before.</p>
<p>It was Firn. Judging from their bewildered expression, they must have finished walking down the stairs just in time to witness the same strangeness that they just had. Which meant…</p>
<p>“Did… did you <i>see</i> that?” they asked weakly, pointing with a quivering arm at the three golden orbs which an instant prior were shining bright and <i>sucking in their mind somehow</i>, but had now gone extinguished.</p>
<p>“Almost missed it, but yeah! That statue just moved on its own!” Rushing to it without a single thought, Firn placed a hand on the empty eyeballs, poking the central one tentatively. “Weren’t its eyes <i>closed</i> before!? Did you know it could open them?”</p>
<p class=vs>With their best friend’s swift curiosity and enthusiasm, Hal could feel a small but rapidly growing headache fill their brain. Describing their mind as <i>cloudy</i> would be a mistake, as in fact, they could feel their thoughts as far more lucid and almost <i>tangible</i> as they had ever been before, but… Well.</p>
<p>It would be more akin to the sensation that <i>something</i> had dug straight into their head, like a young misbehaved hatchling sneaking into Hornfels’ records and stealing one specific cassette whose contents would be related to the past half sunrise or so — then unwound their thoughts memory by memory the same way this same hatchling would enjoy themself seizing the end of the tape and pulling it all out of its casing, little by little, in reverse, with ignorant yet cruel glee — and finally, once finished, left the whole thing for the recorder’s owner to sort out the mess and carefully coil the tape back into the neat black cylindrical reel it was supposed to be left as.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal found themself wincing in confusion when they reluctantly tried to seize the metaphorical tape and do just that: indeed, the moment they tried to focus on putting their latest memories back in order, it was almost as if they could feel themself <i>be there</i> all over again, standing simultaneously inside the museum looking at an excited Firn, and somehow also outside, on the path between the patch of ghost matter and the zero-g cave, talking to a Gossan that they thankfully could tell did not truly exist.</p>
<p>The only solace they found was that they had just enough awareness to remember which of the two settings was the real one, and the fact that the imaginary Hal standing outside by the cliff was talking to Gossan regardless of their present self’s intent helped a lot in this regard. Still– never had reminiscing ever had any right to feel so <i>real</i>.</p>
<p>Just when they thought that Firn would remain completely oblivious to their state of mind and be enthralled by the Nomai statue just as deeply as they themself once had, another pained and slow blink conveniently hid the moment during which the young cadet turned around, their curious and excited smile having turned upside down. “…Wait, no, sorry. Hal, are you okay? You look <i>awful</i>.”</p>
<p class=vs>Hal blinked again, the gesture becoming progressively less strained. The tape of their memories was being recoiled carefully, and they felt immense relief when they realized that those related to their conversation with Gossan had now been put back in order, with the next ones being their quiet past self walking up to the museum. But far too soon came the turn of reviewing their enthusiastic moments spent with Hornfels instead, and again they closed their eyes and sighed, trying their best to ignore both the curator and their past self, and to focus on saying out loud the words they actually wanted to say, instead of those they had already spoken at some earlier point. Admittedly though, keeping their silence altogether was actually the safest bet.</p>
<p>This was such a confusing, and most distressing feeling — the feeling that they could go back and observe their own memories with excruciating detail, as if they were back in the past living through them a second time, all the while feeling like a distant observer trapped within their own body, incapable of interfering with events that had already been set in time. That they could not shake the precognition that it felt as if something <i>else</i> was taking the role of an observer at the same time as they did… Both truths left them struggling to focus proper, and struggling even harder not to let their body tremble in panic, or their nauseated and stressed out stomach churn and turn upside down, their breakfast along with it.</p>
<p>And then came the part they had been dreading the most. To their own despair, Hal now felt themself standing in two different parts of the same room, talking to two different versions of Firn at the same time.</p>
<p>One of the two waved an arm in front of their eyes, filled with concern. “…Hal? Hello?”</p>
<p class=vs>They were pretty sure that this Firn was not from the memory. They were asking a question, and they looked progressively more worried.</p>
<p>Right, if this was the real one, they probably should be answering.</p>
<p>“You’re insufferable,” their lips sluggishly let out by instinct, before their eyes widened and they instantly recoiled in embarrassment. “N-no, wait, wrong one–”</p>
<p>While the echo of the other Firn responded with a smug <i>‘And owning it with pride’</i>, the worried one turned from concern, to confusion <i>and</i> triple the concern. “<i>What?</i>”</p>
<p>“S-<span class=scaps>s</span>orry, just–” Deep breath. “Give me– just a minute.” That would have to do, hopefully.</p>
<p>They decided to close their eyes firmly, inhale loudly, and go back to silence until it was finished. They were almost there, thankfully the memory replaying seemed to be going much faster than the event they represented once had in the real world.</p>
<p>They could not fully tell what present Firn was doing now, but they considered the fact that they only heard a single set of Firn voices playing in the back of their mind in speed motion as a sign that they had probably listened to their plea and fallen silent.</p>
<p>After what had been both a dozen seconds or two, and felt like sixty times that amount, Hal’s mental vision finally aligned with that of their actual eyes: that was to say, the pitch black of their closed eyelids. Letting their head fall backwards, Hal gave a long sigh, then slowly opened their eyes. They felt something on their left shoulder and looked down: Firn’s hand was pressed against it, gentle but insistent. Too embarrassed to break the silence just yet, Hal sent their friend a shy look accompanied with a small grateful smile.</p>
<p>Firn’s eyebrows twitched, staring intently. The light grip on their shoulder gave a small squeeze. “Feeling better now?”</p>
<p>Hal opened their mouth, taking in one last breath. “Yeah… Yeah. Sorry for all that,” they sighed in relief. “That was… wow, that headache felt like a whole dozen of geysers going off at once.” Probably better to call it a ‘headache’ than a… whatever that had just been. Raising a sheepish look at their friend, they quickly added: “But it’s over now, I-<span class=scaps>i</span> think.”</p>
<p>After a short hesitation, the cadet frowned with uncertainty, gave a small nod, and freed their shoulder, retracting their hand. “Any idea what all of that was? First the statue moving on its own, and then… Well, even from you, that was quite the reaction, don’t you think?”</p>
<p class=vs>Hal nodded weakly, stifling a strained laugh. That sure was one way to put it.</p>
<p>Indeed, what even <i>had</i> happened? Hal tried to find so little as a semblance of an answer in recalling what had transpired in this very room barely two or three minutes ago, and — <i>oh no</i>.</p>
<p>Hal saw mental images and sounds surfacing in the back of their mind, and for one moment, they feared that it would be the whole ‘reliving the past and present simultaneously’ experience all over again. However, to their greatest relief, they immediately realized this time that, with those memories being now put in order instead of floating away from their proper place, it had become much easier to keep them under control and make them fade at will. As easy, in a way, as it should be to press play, reverse, forward, and pause, and then put the whole cassette back on its shelf in the records room.</p>
<p class=vs>Nonetheless. Trying not to think too hard about the utter strangeness of it all, Hal searched for the metaphorical cassette they were looking for, finding it in an instant almost before they even had realized that this was the one they were looking for — almost as if something <i>else</i> had first found it for them and shoved it into their hands, responding to their request before they could have found the time to even phrase it.</p>
<p>With an entire body shaking in barely controlled panic and a deep focused breath, they put the recent memory under close, analytical scrutiny, feeling once again as if they were assisted in the process by some external force. Whatever it was, if it existed at all, it sure was insistent – steadfastly bent on making them keep a greedy grip on those moments, on never allowing themself to let them slip away from their mind, on having them dissect every detail of it, for fear that something could possibly erase them soon.</p>
<p class=vs>Anyway.</p>
<p class=vs>Firn had described the statue’s movements.</p>
<p>Nothing about the eyes glowing, or the… the <i>glowing</i> in general, or the <i>everything else</i>.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, there was only one explanation as to why anyone with an iota of common sense, but especially someone like <i>Firn</i>, would express surprise for the former, but not even bother acknowledging the latter’s existence, save for the external effects it had on Hal themself. And so, this reasoning led to one disappointing conclusion:</p>
<p>“…So you didn’t see it,” they mumbled weakly with a twinge of sadness.</p>
<p>Firn frowned again. “See what?”</p>
<p>To be fair, they themself were not certain that they had quite <i>seen</i> any of these floating purple strings, or the eyes’ purple light swallowing them all, either. Not with… not really with their own four eyes, that was. Rather with whichever mental eyes were the ones responsible for making them relive their memories with this amount of vividness which nature should have, and probably <i>did have</i> rightfully prohibited.</p>
<p>Still. Linguistics be thrown to the bramble for just five minutes, because they truly needed at least <i>some</i> amount of leniency, ‘seeing’ would have to do. “I… I think I… saw my own memories replay before me? <i>Backwards?</i>” Yeah. That sounded good enough. This sentence sounded crazy enough on its own, there was no need for even more words that would only make it sound sixty times worse.</p>
<p class=vs>Firn’s eyebrows were raised at first; but soon, their gaze softened instead, as a gentle but teasing smirk appeared in the corner of their lips. “Saw your life flashing before your eyes, huh?” They laughed with their usual sarcasm, though they still gave a genuine attempt at not sounding condescending. “I mean, <i>yeah</i>, I bet seeing that huge thing move on its own just to stare you down would scare the living daylights out of anyone. <span class=smol>…Especially you. No offense.</span>”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite the light dismissiveness of their words, there was a twinge of doubt in the corner of their upper eyes; stupidly easy to startle as Hal was, <i>surely</i> they should have handled this jumpscare better than that… Right?</p>
<p>Hal looked to the ground, humming unconvincingly. That was… a <i>decent enough</i> explanation, perhaps? They replied with a strained chuckle. “Heh… You’d think it was just that. That’d… make sense, I guess.” Turning their eyes to their friend, they tried to replicate their relaxed laugh. It came quite a little bit broken. “Still, I can’t help but feel like… there was more to it?”</p>
<p class=vs>Taking a deep but tense breath right in the next second, Hal tried to appreciate the fact that their mind had finally been allowed to store all the metaphorical cassettes inside their proper metaphorical shelves, and then closed the metaphorical doors to the metaphorical records room, and that with this, their headache was slowly but surely starting to fade in turn.</p>
<p>Now that their thoughts could fully focus on living through no other event than the present, though… The more seconds slipped by, the more distant and outlandish their previous sensations became, fading into none but the blur of a dream in the back of their mind. And as a consequence, with those same seconds slipping by… the more they questioned the possibility that all of this had been nothing but a <i>particularly potent</i> nauseating hallucination caused by their own tendency to scare themself to death at even the tiniest little things.</p>
<p class=vs>They did not know whether trying to reminisce yet another memory on purpose would trigger it again, but truthfully, something they did know was that they <i>did not want to find out</i>. The thought that they had simply had a very weird episode of their own brain turning against them somehow felt more comforting than the prospect of this kind of thing… being permanent.</p>
<p>Feeling the pressure of Firn’s skeptical eyes boring four holes of extreme doubt directly into their skull, what little confidence they had in that ridiculous theory finished crumbling to dust.</p>
<p>“…Ugh, what am I saying,” they sighed tiredly, bringing a hand to their forehead and rubbing away the last trails of tension on their face. “Did the Nomai even have mind-reading technology? Is it even possible?” With another sigh, their other hand went to follow the first so they could rub both pairs of eyes at once. “Forget I said anything. Maybe I just need to lay down for a bit.”</p>
<p>The last remaining traces of Firn’s already fake smirk faltered completely, letting their ears drop with the smallest signs of guilt. Crossing their arms and regaining a determined expression, they turned their eyes again to the latest museum exhibit and huffed with disgruntlement, mind scrambling for any trail which could lead to even the <i>beginning</i> of an explanation.</p>
<p>In the end, they decided to drop any jokes and jump down into the realm of the steady and rough solid grounds normally called <i>evidence</i>. “Well, whatever happened, what’s for sure is that this statue did <i>some</i>thing. It’s been on this planet for <i>weeks</i> and you’ve been standing here <i>all morning</i> for all I know, so why’d it only act up <i>now?</i> You didn’t touch it somewhere new or anything, did you?”</p>
<p>Hal shook their head. “Absolutely not, I was even on my way to <i>leave</i>.”</p>
<p>Firn’s lips opened instinctively, ready to offer the sarcastic hypothesis that perhaps the statue was just feeling lonely and did not want its greatest admirator to abandon it; but just as quickly, they found the physical restraint to close their mouth before it came out.</p>
<p>Tapping an index finger against their elbow with increasingly faster velocity and stronger impact, they pursed their lips and grunted with the frustration of facing a roadblock. A short moment later, they looked Hal up and down one more time, assessing their state, before turning again to the statue. “Where’d you say it came from again?”</p>
<p>Hal’s hands finally managed to stop trembling, they just noticed after looking down. Raising their head back to their best friend, they frowned, then replied with decisiveness: “Giant’s Deep. It was Gabbro who found it.”</p>
<p>Firn nodded. Their back was still turned to them, but they rotated their head just enough for Hal to see that they were sending them a mischievous grin. Mischievous not out of ill intent at the prospect of them preparing another nefarious plan, or at least they did not believe so… But rather, this mischief appeared to have found its spark in the hope of finally having a thread to start with.</p>
<p>“Forget the Attlerock. I know which planet I’m crashing my ship into.”</p>
<p>Hal’s ears twitched nervously, face crumpling in worry. “D-do you <i>have</i> to say ‘crash’?” they cringed, trying all over again to dismiss the mental image. Fortunately, it was the mental image of something that had never happened, so it seemed like their brain would not suddenly try to go look for a cassette that did not exist and force them to witness it. “Also, that’s not… You think Hornfels would agree to let you go there on your first trip? From what Gabbro said, it sounds pretty dangerous, with the current, and the storms, not to mention the—”</p>
<p>Firn rolled their eyes in annoyance. “I’ll <i>make</i> them agree. It’s important to you, and it’s related to the statue they’ve been obsessing over. With reasons as big as that, I’m sure they’ll allow a last-minute change of plans.”</p>
<p>They tried to argue, but by the time their mouth opened, their friend had already grabbed their wrist, looking at them with four eyes filled with determination.</p>
<p>“Come on,” they said with a much softer tone and an encouraging smile. “You’ll even get to scold me over the radio if you feel like it. Sure Hornfels would like for that to happen.”</p>
<p>With an anxious sigh, Hal reluctantly let their friend guide them to the observatory. Before they turned around and aimed for the stairs, they gave one last glance at the statue — this time, not with awe, but with disdain and apprehension.</p>
<p>Even now that they had broken eye contact with it… Somehow, they still felt distinctly observed.</p>
<hr>
<p>The moment Hornfels heard that the statue’s eyes had opened, their ears closed to any other potential detail to that story, and their role as ground control had been all but forgotten. With only one idea in mind, the one who had now put on their museum curator’s hat instead wanted nothing to do with the observatory, and everything to do with the statue room.</p>
<p>Which was precisely why Firn did everything in their power to stop them from leaving their post.</p>
<p>“Firn, how can you share such news and not even let me <i>study</i> it!? I’ve spent night after night for <i>weeks</i> trying to get those eyes to open, and now that they have, you won’t let me go down and find out why they did? Just go to the Attlerock like we all agreed, surely you don’t need me for that!”</p>
<p>“And that’s what I’m trying to tell you, Hornfels, that’s <i>exactly</i> why I’m going to <i>Giant’s Deep!</i>”</p>
<p>“You can’t just change your flight plans at the last second, let alone on your first launch! Why would you even want to go this far off-planet when I already have all the tools I could ever need inside the workshop?”</p>
<p>Firn rolled their eyes. “And I say it’ll be much more useful to investigate directly the place where it came from! What are you going to do, stay in the museum, point your signalscope at it, and look for brain waves all day?”</p>
<p>The curator frowned, leaving their desk and making their way towards the stairs. “I’m not sure why you would mention <i>brain waves</i> specifically, but I will have you know that using an encephalogram under these circumstances would be a far more relevant approach—”</p>
<p>The astronaut crossed their arms and frowned deeply, deliberately blocking the path. “Hornfels, I’m getting off this rock <i>today</i>, and I’m gonna figure this whole thing out right from where that statue came from. I have the translator and a radio, I can report everything I find in real time!”</p>
<p>“Firn, as much as I value your interest in solving this statue’s mystery, you really shouldn’t change your flight schedule at such short notice,” the founder tried to reason with cautious concern. “This is your first launch, you need to understand that Giant’s Deep might remain a little more than you can chew for now. You will have all the time to investigate there on later expeditions, and perhaps find more statues to study—”</p>
<p>Firn’s fists clenched. Barely controlled boiling blood coiled into a thick ball inside their throat. “It’s not about the <i>statue</i>, Hornfels!” they finally exploded. “It did <i>something</i> to Hal, and I’m going to <i>find out</i> what it was, you hear me?”</p>
<p>Hal gasped, looking wide-eyed at their friend. They were not sure what to think… Had Firn actually believed their story about the statue reading their mind? But also, were they even planning on convincing Hornfels as well…?</p>
<p>Speaking of Hornfels, their eyebrows fell at once, gaze now jumping from one hatchling to the other back and forth, as they startled as well — albeit, for a different reason. “What exactly do you mean by ‘did something’?”</p>
<p>“I said I was <i>going</i> to find out,” Firn repeated angrily.</p>
<p>The curator turned to their friend with confusion and concern. “Hal, what are they talking about? The statue turned to you and opened its eyes, that much I understand, but– there was <i>more</i> to it?”</p>
<p>Hal took a step back, unsure how to describe their experience and make it sound anything other than utterly mad and nonsensical. “It’s… it’s complicated, I didn’t even think Firn would– believe me.”</p>
<p>Firn crossed their arms. “Which is why I’m saying I’m not sure what happened,” they stated coldly.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal’s ears dropped at the same time as their eyes turning to the ground. That made more sense; of course they wouldn’t accept something so outlandish just like that.</p>
<p class=vs>They were, however, quite surprised to feel Firn grabbing their wrist and squeezing lightly, as if to try and somewhat comfort them. When they looked up at their face, they found the expression that had truly earned Firn’s place in the Outer Wilds Ventures program:</p>
<p>The expression of a dedicated, analytical and thorough investigator.</p>
<p>“<i>Something</i> happened alright, <i>I was right there</i>,” Firn continued. “But Hal says there was more to it, something only they saw— something to do with their mind, or memories, right?” The cadet gave a quick look in their direction; Hal gave them a tiny nod, and they nodded in return with a hum. “Point is, it’s hard for now to tell how much of it was just Hal trying to recover from the fright, and how much of it was the statue <i>really</i> doing something. But I’m willing to believe that if a however-old-that-thing-is statue just moved on its own to specifically turn towards them— I hardly think the Nomai would create that kind of thing just for the sake of scaring people out of their skins. It <i>had</i> to have another purpose.”</p>
<p>It had been a whole minute or two since Hornfels had fallen silent, listening to their reasoning; their face made it hard to tell whether it was because they were actively listening and agreeing with this train of logic, or if they had simply given up on trying to stop them.</p>
<p>Firn let go of their arm so they could go back to crossing their own, and with one last head tilt upwards, they brought their demonstration to its conclusion: “And now I’m getting to my real point: <i>even</i> if whatever happened was all in Hal’s head and the statue did nothing else, I still believe the statue was <i>meant</i> to do something else; and if it didn’t do it, it means either that it’s broken, or that Gabbro took it away from the rest of the mechanism it was supposed to be a part of, which also means that it’s technically broken. In both cases: we have <i>zero chances</i> of figuring out what the statue was meant to do by staring at it downstairs, and our only way to find any answers is to explore Giant’s Deep.”</p>
<p>And with those last words being uttered, the young cadet fell silent and stared defiantly, wordlessly daring Hornfels to so much as try to think of a counterargument.</p>
<p>Hal was impressed, that was for sure. Impressed by what, however, was far less certain. Were they more impressed by the apparent flawlessness and fluidity of their reasoning, or by the fact that at the end of the day, the sole objective behind said reasoning had been nothing but the self-centered motivation of making it impossible to stop them from doing what they wanted?</p>
<p>Hornfels stared for what had to be almost an entire minute. Then, they brought an exasperated hand to their lowered face and started rubbing the bridge of their nose. With a heavy and loud defeated sigh, they conceded: “<i>Fine</i>, have it your way! But I am <i>not</i> letting you do this alone. Go meet up with Gabbro first, you are going to need someone who has the field experience.”</p>
<p>Firn’s smirk turned insufferably triumphant. It was not a complete victory, but it was good enough, and just about the best outcome they could have hoped for. “Deal.”</p>
<p>And without any other word, the newest astronaut turned around and practically ran down the stairs, barely sending Hal one last wave with a distracted hand.</p>
<p>Hal so dearly hoped that Gabbro would manage to keep them safe.</p><p>Somehow.</p>
<hr>
<p>Taking off had been easy. Firn remembered their training, they had located and memorized all the buttons on their dashboard weeks ago down to their size and color, and they had no reason to stay a single second longer than necessary on the soil of Timber Hearth.</p>
<p>Locating Giant’s Deep while out of the atmosphere had been a little more difficult. Firn remembered that it was high up in the zenith when they woke up, but that was just about a whole hour earlier; and in this span of time, the planet had been granted enough time to get to the other side of the Hearthian sky.</p>
<p>Locating Gabbro became even harder when Firn realized that they probably should have remembered to turn on their ship’s signalscope <i>before</i> entering its atmosphere and having to suddenly keep all four eyes not on trying to find the signal of a barely audible flute (were they even playing at all? They could not pick up any signal on planet), but instead on the dozen of cyclones raging all around them.</p>
<p>Firn did not want to admit to Hornfels that <i>maybe</i> their training had not quite yet taught them how to time last-second dodges between moving walls of wind and water.</p>
<p>And <i>Gabbro</i>— What were they <i>doing?</i> They couldn’t pick up their signal anywhere!</p>
<p class=vs>Another cyclone had to be dodged— and as they were forced to turn around in a full half circle in order to evade <i>yet another</i>, they sputtered in shock as they saw an entire <i>island</i> fall from the sky, and right back into the ocean.</p>
<p>Wait… A black trail seemed to be coming out of it. Was that smoke? A campfire!</p>
<p>Their signalscope finally decided to pick up a sound coming from the Outer Wilds Ventures frequency. Gabbro’s flute was always the hardest to listen to due to its low volume and pitch, and the surrounding howling winds certainly did not make it any easier now… But if on top of this the island had not even <i>been</i> on the surface of the planet until just a few seconds ago, then <i>of course</i> trying to locate it was a plan bound for failure.</p>
<p class=vs>Still, that was not all. Firn instantly noticed that this time… Gabbro’s playing sounded a lot more strained and tired than usual.</p><p>To be fair, if Firn themself had been the one being thrown up into orbit and then back down like this, they likely would not be playing at all… But still. This kind of playing was not by a long shot the most Gabbro-like, and they could only try to imagine why.</p>
<p>Well, whatever was happening, it was no use trying to play guessing games when they could simply find out upon landing. A minute more, and their ship made physical contact with solid ground, landing in an area which was mercifully as flat as wild terrain could ever hope to be.</p>
<p>Firn unbuckled, checked the airtightness of their suit just like Gossan had taught them, then opened the hatch and jumped down.</p>
<p>…and instantly regretted their thoughtless leap, as their knees sent shivers up their spine with what felt like the closest thing they thought they would ever get to breaking their legs.</p>
<p>They frowned at the ground, attempting another jump only to barely manage not to collapse under their own doubled weight, and to barely fail at repressing the instinct to flail their arms around to maintain their balance upon landing.</p>
<p>Right. Giant’s Deep was a <i>giant</i>. Gravity was on average double that of Timber Hearth. Ow.</p>
<p>So much for looking forward to the Attlerock’s low gravity and the fun prospect of magically losing two thirds of their usual weight.</p>
<p>With an exasperated sigh, Firn reached out for their signalscope and followed the music, minding the patch of ghost matter that they soon noticed nearby.</p>
<p>And then, finally, there stood Gabbro. And by ‘stood’, it would be far more appropriate to specify that they were, in fact, not standing at all, unless ‘standing’ horizontally inside a hammock could be a grammatically correct wording. Firn instantly frowned and let a groan resonate inside their throat, because <i>of course they would</i>.</p>
<p>Turning on their helmet’s radio emitter, they called out with the most polite tone and hand wave they could muster, and the sound of flute instantly stopped. From the hammock, a helmet ever so slightly turned and peeked out, looking around somewhat groggily until their eyes could pinpoint the source. Cons of having to rely on radio for communication even when both parties were barely a dozen meters apart: you could not trust your ears to locate the other’s spacial position relative to yours.</p>
<p>“Firn? Oh hey, it’s really you,” Gabbro greeted, voice still crackling through the receiver despite their proximity. “Good to see you made it here in one piece. The first solo launch is a doozy, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class=vs>Firn hummed deep in thought as they walked closer, finally making it to their side.</p>
<p>As much as <i>‘Gabbro is Gabbro’</i> was a well-known rule in the entire village, the young cadet could not fail to notice how much more… <i>out there</i> they sounded. As in, even more than usual.</p>
<p>“Let me tell you, the past ten minutes sure have been a doozy for myself too,” they continued, words coming out almost sluggish.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah? …Well, I mean, I guess I did see your entire island fall from the sky.”</p>
<p>Firn’s radio picked up on a tired, unenergetic snort. “Heh, nah, I’m used to that. Island’s only up for a minute at most, the real crazy thing started a bit earlier.” There was a short pause, as if the astronaut was actively struggling to find their words, or almost even to do so much as remain aware of the fact that they were supposed to be part of a conversation. “Another island drifted by, so I thought I’d take advantage of the proximity to do some field work and explore… but I was there for barely a minute or two when I found that… something… and then that happened. Don’t laugh, but I think I sort of, uh, had a spiritual experience with a rock shaped like a face.”</p>
<p>Firn tensed up. “You mean a statue?”</p>
<p>The older astronaut snapped their fingers and pointed at them in short-lived gratitude. “A <i>statue</i>, yes. Got uh, some words mixed up right after it happened, heh. That sure was <i>something</i>, felt like getting my whole brain turned upside down for a bit. After that I figured it’d been more than enough emotions for the day and that I’d frankly deserved some rest to, uh. Get my thoughts together before trying to go back and take a better look.”</p>
<p>Firn squinted, openly disappointed. “So you came back to lie in your hammock.”</p>
<p>Gabbro turned their helmet in their direction, eyeing them with an unreadable look. “Got a problem with that?”</p>
<p>“You don’t want to figure out what that was all about?”</p>
<p>Gabbro somehow managed to dig themself deeper inside the hammock. “As I said: <i>later</i>.” A pause. They raised their flute. “Probably.” They sighed. “Not gonna lie, it’s been <i>really</i> tempting to remove my helmet and get something done about that headache, but I don’t wanna take the risk of that fury over there coming for <i>another</i> visit.”</p>
<p>Gabbro started playing again, music once again far more strained than usual. Firn wondered why they kept playing if they could barely even keep the rhythm right.</p>
<p>Their hands clenched into fists. “Remember the statue you brought back to Timber Hearth? That happened to Hal too.”</p>
<p>There was a wheezing, far too high-pitched note, then the music stopped again. And then, silence and stillness came, as if Gabbro was pretending that this bum note had been all in Firn’s imagination. Then, a dozen seconds later:</p>
<p>“…Ah,” they mumbled flatly. Silence again. “They, uh, doing alright?”</p>
<p>“They’re holding up. They should be with Hornfels, I’d planned to radio them soon after landing.”</p>
<p>Gabbro nodded. “Good. Good. Kinda surprised they wouldn’t have, like, thrown up after this. Sure is a trip, and not the fun kind.”</p>
<p>Firn let an audible grunt resonate and die in their throat. Gabbro turned their head again.</p>
<p>“…So <i>that’s</i> why you’re here even if it’s your first launch, huh. It went after Hal, so now it got <i>personal</i>.”</p>
<p>“And you should be taking it personally too!” Firn scolded. “Hal’s gotten better after just a few minutes. Gonna put my mallows on you exaggerating it as an excuse to take the day off.”</p>
<p>A pause. The elder astronaut stared at their flute.</p>
<p>“It really was that bad, buddy.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ve seen Hal, and now that I’m seeing you too, I’ll believe you on that. Just saying— emphasis on <i>was</i>. Hal was completely back to normal just a few minutes later, save for the part where they’re obviously still freaked out about it.”</p>
<p class=vs>Gabbro mumbled something about Hal being logical and good at sorting their own ideas, and about their own brain already being messy from the start even before their statue friend threw a cyclone out of its eyes and into theirs to instantly get back out and suck basically all of their memories straight into orbit, and that <i>stars above</i> it was not fun to try maintaining a conversation when it felt like all their memories were still somewhat scrambled and vivid in their mind, so frankly they would be <i>extremely</i> thankful if they could leave and let them meditate as an attempt to chase all that away.</p><p>Firn raised an eyebrow at all that, but decided not to take any of it at face value, given the amount of evident metaphors and the lack of any solid, tangible evidence in their words.</p>
<p>“Welp,” the cadet sighed, “I’m radioing Hornfels. Thanks for the warm welcome,” they added with an annoyed roll of their upper eyes.</p>
<p>“Sure, knock yourself out,” they sighed with a dismissive wave of their hand. “Just tone it down a bit. You’re loud, it’s hard to focus. The cyclones are bad enough on their own.”</p>
<p>With another grunting sigh, Firn walked a few steps away (not that the distance would change much regarding the volume of their voice in Gabbro’s receiver, but the thought was there) and pointed their signalscope at the sky.</p>
<p>“Firn to ground control, do you copy?”</p>
<p><span class=radio>“Firn!”</span> Hal’s voice immediately rang out in both relief and panic, somehow. <span class=radio>“Y-you didn’t crash, did you?”</span></p>
<p>They stifled an amused laugh. “Well thanks for the vote of confidence. Yeah, I’m good. I found Gabbro too, as we agreed.”</p>
<p>From hundreds of kilometers away, another sigh of relief resonated, this time more likely coming from Hornfels.</p>
<p>“Say, Hal? About the statue— Gabbro said that something similar happened to them.” Then, turning to the astronaut in question: “How’d you phrase it again?”</p>
<p>“Spiritual experience with a rock shaped like a face,” they tiredly recited without hesitation. Blinking, they perked up in surprise: “…Huh. I actually remembered the exact wording.”</p>
<p>“You said it, like, two minutes ago,” Firn deadpanned.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, with how <i>backwards</i> my entire brain is right now, forgive me for being happy to find something even remotely coherent in it,” Gabbro deadpanned right back.</p>
<p>Hal’s voice crackled again through the radio. <span class=radio>“Can I, uh— Gabbro, do you remember how it was like?”</span></p>
<p>“You’re saying ‘was’ as if it were over for me,” they grumbled weakly. “Honestly, I think ‘brain backwards’ is a good enough summary.”</p>
<p class=radio>“…Ah. Uh. How long ago did the statue do the— you know, the glowing eyes thing?”</p>
<p>“A bit more than ten minutes ago. I think. Kinda hard to tell how fast time passes when I’m trying to tell apart which cyclones are real and why I’m somehow seeing and <i>hearing</i> double, with half of it being in fast motion.” A pause. “Unless it’s the other half going in slow motion. What if we were all living in slow motion, and we just never realized it? …Does ‘slow’ or ‘fast’ motion even make sense as absolutes, or do they only make sense once put in the context of a different speed? But then, what could the ‘absolute’ speed even be…?”</p>
<p>This time, the voice that came out of the radio was that of Hornfels, and they were audibly displeased. <span class=radio>“Gabbro, did you get alien algae fumes in your oxygen tank? And Hal—”</span></p>
<p>“What? No!” Gabbro cried out, hurt by the accusation. “…Not <i>this</i> time, at least.” Geysers, they did not dare imagine how much <i>horribly worse</i> that would have made this whole thing, given the fact that this was an already far too upsetting experience.</p>
<p>Hal’s voice thankfully came to their defense: <span class=radio>“N-no, I, uh, I think that sort of makes sense. It did feel like that too for me, for a little while.”</span> After a quick pause which was certainly spent trying to quietly convince Hornfels that they were not completely out of their mind, they added: <span class=radio>“At least I do have good news, Gabbro, it should be over soon. I’m pretty sure it’s all back to normal for me by now. Sort of.”</span></p>
<p class=vs>Gabbro closed their eyes and took a deep, relieved breath. Usually, they were all for new experiences; but the fact that this one was forcing them into <i>lucidity</i> instead of allowing them to embrace the hypnotic trance instigated by the twirling cyclones was something that they found not only odd, but also actively against the flow of everything they enjoyed.</p>
<p>Was it weird to say that they did not enjoy that lucidity? Probably, unless they could specify that there <i>was</i> such a thing as too much lucidity. Having your own brain make you process and relive your latest memories in the back of your mind at the same time as you were trying to hold a normal conversation <i>definitely</i> counted as too much lucidity.</p>
<p>“Cool. Nice to know,” they nodded, already feeling calmer from that news alone. “Kinda wish your friend could’ve made it here <i>after</i> that point, then.”</p>
<p>There was silence, as Firn turned to the older astronaut with an uncertain look. Hal’s voice soon pulled them out of their thoughts: <span class=radio>“…Ah, uh… Yeah, Firn? Please don’t be too hard on them if they’re still, uh. Putting things back in order.”</span></p>
<p>“Putting <i>what</i> in order?” Firn frowned. “Their brain?”</p>
<p class=radio>“…Sort of…? —Look, Hornfels, I <i>know</i> how crazy this sounds, okay? You don’t need to tell me that it’s not <i>normal</i> to feel like you’re living through two different moments at the same time, and it sure isn’t fun trying to hold a conversation when you’re <i>already</i> having another conversation happening inside your head at the same time.”</p>
<p>Firn kept their silence once again, struggling to believe it, yet also now accepting the fact that two Hearthians had separately developed the same symptoms from the same experience on two different planets, and that what Hal had just described provided a reasonable enough explanation for their earlier behavior in the statue room.</p>
<p>“Yeah, now we really <i>have</i> to investigate these statues and where they came from,” they still stated gravely. Then, with another glance at the hammock: “…as soon as Gabbro’s up for it, I guess. Hope it won’t take long.”</p>
<p>“Mneh, you can just go without me,” the astronaut in question waved with a tired hand before they once again brought their flute to their helmet. “Knowing you, I’d just slow you down even if I were in top form.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Hornfels instantly disagreed with this mindset. <span class=radio>“Gabbro, this is Firn’s <i>first launch</i>, and they chose as their first destination a planet filled with thunder, a raging ocean with drifting islands which render any attempts at mapping it futile, and <i>cyclones</i>. Having an experienced astronaut to keep an eye on them will prove extremely valuable, all the more when you <i>already have</i> visited the place they intend to investigate.”</span></p>
<p>Firn grunted under their breath. They were hoping that ground control would rather put an emphasis on the latter half of that argument and skip the patronizing part.</p>
<p>Gabbro begrudgingly put the flute down, letting it rest on their chest for a while. “Fine. You’re the boss, Horns.” Their helmet turned to Firn: “Think you can turn down the signalscope and get prepared now. Will join you in a sec.”</p>
<p>But they did not move a muscle. Firn stared, then crossed their arms. Their finger started tapping their elbow again. They tried to keep in mind Hal’s words about giving them some space and quiet, and decided to grant Gabbro the same patience they had given Hal when it had been their turn to momentarily shut them down.</p>
<p>Then, finally, after a long pause: “…Okay, I think I’m good. Emphasis on <i>think</i>.”</p>
<p>And with a tired sigh, Gabbro sat up and unceremoniously threw their legs over the hammock, jumping down and letting their knees bounce down and back up as they landed, evidently well-practiced in the arts of dealing with the increased gravity and knowing how to efficiently cushion the strain on their legs.</p>
<p>Firn watched as the older astronaut set their flute inside the hammock, gave it a little pat, and took advantage of their momentarily free hands to stretch. “So, while you’re getting ready,” they questioned with their impatient finger still tapping ever faster, “where do you think we should investigate? Did you also fish your other statue from the ocean, or was it standing somewhere specific?”</p>
<p>“Somewhere specific,” Gabbro answered without hesitation as they stopped walking towards their jetpack and raised their head high up, looking around and over the horizon. “Let’s see if it’s still… A<i>ha</i>.” They pointed at a different island, and Firn squinted as they tried to take in its dual shape, blurred by the distance and the fog in-between. “My statue was on the beach of that island. It was practically a jump away when I decided to go take a quick look, but then my island was tossed up in space soon after I was back, and…”</p>
<p>Firn’s mouth gaped. “You said you found that statue like, <i>ten minutes ago</i>,” they heaved in shock, “and it’s already <i>that</i> far away!?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well,” there was a huff as they tightened their jetpack’s belt, “the current’s pretty strong, in case you hadn’t noticed. Islands drift apart and into each other all the time. Kinda why we gave up on trying to chart the planet.”</p>
<p>With their jetpack now firmly in place, Gabbro then turned to their hammock and reached out; but before they could pick up their trusty companion, Firn’s arm grabbed theirs from behind their back and pulled away.</p>
<p>From under their visor, Gabbro’s eyes widened in sudden haste. “Wait, my flute–!”</p>
<p>“—isn’t going anywhere,” the cadet interrupted while tugging with even more force, “so let’s launch before that island gets any further!”</p>
<p>And with that, Gabbro found themself dragged away from their hammock and soon right into the beam of Firn’s ship, with the new astronaut closing the hatch a second after their landing inside, and then jumping straight into the pilot’s seat before they even had the time to blink.</p>
<p>At least there was oxygen in there. Gabbro removed their helmet and gladly let their gloved hand run through their entire face, thankful at least that this small ship’s walls protected them all at once from the rain, the roar of the wind, and the risk of running out of breathable air any second a cyclone would feel moody.</p>
<p>And then, the moment later the ship took off, and despite the gravity crystal being perfectly intact, Gabbro was taken off-guard and fell flat on their face with a pained grunt. Their first fully headache-free thought was something related to the fact that they were pretty sure that ‘hatchling-sitting’ was not on their job resume.</p>
<p>This was going to be a <i>long</i> day.</p>

<!-- @SFOLD — 001 — CHAPTER 3: The Rock That Looks Like a Face Rock ————————————————————————————————————————————————————— -->
<div class=chp id=ch3_1><h1>Chapter 3</h1><h2>The Rock That Looks Like a Face Rock</h2><hr>
<p>In the defense of the newest astronaut to enter the Outer Wilds Ventures program: out of all astral bodies in their entire solar system, Giant’s Deep clearly was on the lowest tier in terms of orientation and flight maneuverability. Dark Bramble set aside for reasons that none needed to elaborate, a close second would likely be Ember Twin, and that would be solely if you were enough of a lunatic to deliberately bring your ship down inside the equatorial canyon and play tag with the column of sand.</p>
<p>In comparison, Brittle Hollow was a cinch as long as you could look out for the Lantern’s constant but predictable and relatively tranquil clouds of falling ash (it was only recently that a note from Riebeck mentioned that it had started spouting actual blobs of lava at the planet, but such spike in the moon’s volcanic activity had still gone largely undocumented given the fact that it was barely a few days old) and were not crazy enough to try and <i>fly</i> a ship <i>underground</i>. Provided you could even find a hole big enough to fit it through the crust, that was.</p>
<p class=vs>And finally, good old Timber Hearth was more or less out of competition for ‘Rutile has threatened to shut down the program if any astronaut were to dare fly too close to the village while in low altitude for any purpose other than launching or landing’ reasons. The only other difficulty that could be noted with this planet would be the geysers, but it simply was a matter of keeping an eye on the ground and looking out for their locations in order to very simply <i>not fly right on top of them like a</i>…</p>
<p>…Well, there was a reason why the Hearthian language had many generations ago come up with the term ‘geyser-jumper.’</p>
<p>And so, yes. There was not that much competition to begin with, granted, but this did not change the fact that <i>usually</i>, when looking at the recommended order in which a still-learning astronaut should visit the outer wilds’ various planets… Giant’s Deep was pretty close to the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>This planet was two things: powerful enough to hijack your ship from the outside, and dangerously unpredictable. It went without saying that this did not amount to a very beginner-friendly combination.</p>
<p>Again, Gabbro had to hand it to the newest astronaut: despite the giant’s constant mood swings throwing their ship around like a disgruntled hatchling would kick pebbles into ponds at the smallest inconvenience, Firn was doing a surprisingly fine job not falling into panic. Perhaps because they were already too busy falling into anger instead.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate, but… Gabbro could not in good conscience refer to their piloting as ‘cut out for the job.’ Their constant tendency to overcompensate, fighting against the rain and winds for control instead of letting them guide their hand towards an alternate path, showed their definite lack of field experience; and if the raging gales had anything to say about it, patience and compliance were precisely what this planet demanded from its visitors.</p>
<p>It was a shame that any time Gabbro tried to approach a hand to the controls for a slight and smooth adjustment to what was going to be a rocky trajectory change a second later, it was instantly slapped away without a second thought.</p>
<p class=vs>To be fair, Firn <i>had</i> been promised a first solo launch. It wouldn’t be much of a ‘solo’ if they were just going to act like a surrogate Gossan, and nobody enjoyed being on the receiving end of broken promises.</p>
<p>…Even though their barely recovering brain was now stuck pondering how it was even possible to feel this many tremors from inside the ship, when this was precisely what the gravity crystal was meant to mitigate down to nonexistence.</p>
<p>Another cyclone almost threw them into orbit, Firn barely succeeding in escaping its pull at the last second, but the force of nature had nonetheless managed to tilt their altitude upwards enough to momentarily make them kiss the clouds. For perhaps the twelfth time or so since they had embarked and launched, Gabbro heard the young cadet grit their teeth and grunt at the frustration of losing control of their own ship — at the frustration that they so dearly wished they could keep pretending to be more competent than they truly were.</p>
<p>Gossan had given them the permission to go, that was for certain, and Firn’s piloting skills did show that they had everything down theory-wise, memorized and perfected, ready to jump into practice. This level of skill was definitely enough for a first launch to go smoothly… had they stuck to the original plan of simply following the same schedule as every first launch: landing on the Attlerock, roasting a mallow or two with Esker, and then having some mindless fun walking around in low gravity.</p>
<p class=vs>All in all: Firn surely would make for a great pilot, someday. They simply needed practice.</p>
<p>A <i>lot</i> more practice.</p>
<p>Firn glanced down with concern at the thick and opaque upper atmosphere blocking all sunlight from view — glancing down indeed, as this occurred during a fleeting second when their ship happened to be upside down. After a short seething inhale, they asked: “Should we be worried about that storm?”</p>
<p><i>Not nearly as much as the likelihood of your piloting sending us straight into the nearest island sooner or later</i>, Gabbro did not say. Instead, with a light unbothered shrug: “Eh. Not really. I’ve yet to see any bolt reaching down, they tend to stay up there doing their thing from within the clouds. And even when you’re in there, it doesn’t seem like they’re interested in hitting our ships,” they explained nonchalantly. “The real danger you’ll want to look out for are the cyclones, but—”</p>
<p>“I’m <i>already aware</i> of the cyclones, <i>thank you very much</i>.”</p>
<p>“—Yeah, was about to say. Pretty hard to miss.”</p>
<hr>
<p>It took much longer than both astronauts would have preferred, but Firn eventually managed to catch up with the island they were looking for, with Gabbro confirming that it was indeed the right one. It wasn’t long before they spotted the glow of a gravity beam, radiating off the ground from what appeared from afar to be a circular platform. The young cadet went straight for it without hesitation, relieved to finally find something in the wildness of this planet that would hopefully reveal itself to be <i>helpful</i> — disregarding the fact that this Nomai construct was, by definition, not truly part of the ‘wildness’ per se.</p>
<p>The sudden pull took Firn by surprise, far more than they would ever want to admit. The angle at which they had brought their ship to it was close enough to verticality that both astronauts feared for a moment that the artificial gravity would pull them to the ground upside-down; but thankfully, despite landing only half of the ship on the pad and the other half on the beach, resulting in a noticeable and uncomfortable tilt, this was overall an acceptable success.</p>
<p>A second later, the clicking of unbuckling resounded, and yet another second later, Firn was pushing Gabbro to the side, opening the hatch, and jumping down, this time being more mindful of the strain the giant’s gravity would subject their legs to. By the time Gabbro jumped down after them, the hatchling was already three dozen meters away and not showing any signs of stopping, as they had instantly noticed amongst the rocks and sand what appeared to be a flight of stairs.</p>
<p>“Slow down, buddy,” Gabbro called out into their radio, only for their tired request to be royally ignored.</p>
<p>Hardly turning around for a split second, Firn’s only response was to retort “Wanna figure out what happened to you and Hal or not!?”</p>
<p>With a sigh, Gabbro gave up on trying to remind them that their impatience and enthusiasm should not prevent them from keeping an eye on their resource levels. Fearing that they would soon lose sight of them, the older astronaut was forced into a little jog — refusing to go any faster than that. Just walking on this planet was supposed to be exercise enough, thank you; not to mention that more exercise was also synonym to an increased oxygen consumption.</p>
<p class=vs>Firn climbed eons old stairs, walked along a clearly set path that the Nomai had undoubtedly constructed and followed long before them… and soon faced a broken bridge across the ocean.</p>
<p>Brilliant as they were, even the Nomai could not defy nature for this long. It truly should be unsurprising that time had taken a toll on their architecture and machines; and in fact, it should have been far more surprising that the damage was ultimately so limited — almost as surprising as the sturdiness of trees in outer space, and their inherent resistance to ship thrusters and atmosphere reentry despite their innate property of being flammable.</p>
<p>Firn walked up to the edge, looking down into the rather intimidating drop, then assessing the distance between them and the closest part of debris they could hope to reach. They were now all too aware of the increased gravity’s impact on their movements, and expected its effects to reach out to their jetpack as well; it was fortunate that their brand new suit came with a fuel tank filled to the brim.</p>
<p>They took a few steps backwards, carefully calculating their next actions all the while, then decided to walk all the way to the other end of their platform for good measure. And then, just as Gabbro’s head was peeking over from behind their back, they darted forward without hesitation and activated their thrusters at full force the moment they reached the edge, jumping as high and far as they could, and preparing themself for a heavy landing on the other side.</p>
<p class=vs>They made their jump, landing almost at the center of the other platform, and took a second to press their hands on their knees and take a breath, mentally patting themself on the back for this little achievement. They stopped panting after a few seconds, and raised their head again to look forward…</p>
<p>…only to notice that there was another gap to cross. With a groan, their eyes immediately fell right to the ground once more.</p>
<p>Gabbro landed next to them with the grace of years of practice and experience, gave them a little pat on the back — a real one this time, with the tiniest wordless snicker to boot — before taking the next leap and landing on the other half of the island, waving at them from there.</p>
<p>In this moment, Firn decided that Giant’s Deep <i>sucked</i>.</p>
<hr>
<p>When Firn made their second jump, Gabbro had turned their back to them. They had decided to wait for them by standing in the same position as they had just a dozen of minutes or two earlier, transfixed by the same sight they had witnessed then — by the statue which had, technically speaking, pretty much assaulted their mind without permission or warning. Just like the previous time, it was lying in the sand, motionless and half buried in it, only difference being its now fully open eyes looking vacantly at both nothing and everything.</p>
<p>“So that’s the one that opened its eyes at you,” the young cadet asserted, nodding at their own words with confidence.</p>
<p>An accurate guess, not too difficult to conclude from the context and clues lying around; still, Gabbro nodded and hummed in return, thinking that they would nonetheless appreciate the external confirmation.</p>
<p>Gabbro caught the sight of some shuffling around in the corner of their upper eye, and when they turned to look at Firn again, they had started to make their way closer to the statue, scout launcher in hand. There were a couple bright flashes of light as they used the photo mode all around, at both the statue and its surroundings, from all relevant sides they could think of. Many photos were taken with little to no pause in-between them, with Firn stopping only once or twice overall when it appeared that the result displayed on their helmet’s <span class=scaps>hud</span> gave a satisfying angle.</p>
<p>A dozen seconds later, and Firn lost interest in the statue, turning instead to the carved cliff to their right — and more specifically, to a small pillar with what appeared to be some Nomai writings carved on its top, standing beside a closed door of sorts.</p>
<p class=vs>In silence, Gabbro had a double take, blinking a few times as they took just a few steps closer to the epigraph. Was that wiggly spiral glowing the last time they were here?</p>
<p class=vs>Whatever the case, Firn did not seem surprised by it. They simply pulled out a shiny new tool which certainly had to be that translator they and Hal had been working so hard on perfecting up to the last time Gabbro had visited Timber Hearth, and they pointed it at the carving without a word.</p>
<p>A few fancy lasers came out to scan multiple spots at once, soon displaying a short text on the tiny screen; and with another confused blink and a pair of raised eyebrows, Gabbro noticed that the glow had partially faded in response. Weird. Also kind of weird that Firn paid it no mind, but chances were that they simply were used to it, what with the whole thing around having built the device to begin with and all that.</p>
<p>At any rate, the scout launcher was out a few seconds later, and again there were a couple of pictures taken. Then, the cadet turned to them and, for lack of being able to cross their arms because of the bulky equipment keeping one of them busy, Firn opted instead for gluing their free hand to their hip. Their index finger instantly started tapping against it.</p>
<p>“So,” they said decisively, breaking the silence at once. “The sign reads ‘Statue Workshop.’ That sounds encouraging.” They turned their head to the door, adding flatly: “Except the path is blocked, because of course it is.”</p>
<p>Gabbro took a few relaxed steps forward, nodding. “Yeah, I think it’s one of those Nomai airlocks. As you can tell, that one’s busted.” They watched as the new astronaut, undeterred, walked forward anyway and scratched at the edges of the stone, if only to try and see if they could take a peek at the other side; and after a few seconds, Gabbro shook their head and sighed. “Good luck trying to pry it open by force when it weighs twice the amount it already would on Timber Hearth, buddy. If you get squashed, I’m not pulling you out from under it.”</p>
<p>Firn let go and turned around, all four rolling eyes somehow radiating even past their visor. “I&nbsp;wasn’t gonna.”</p>
<p>“You were considering it.”</p>
<p>The hatchling let a grunt resonate inside their throat, but decided to drop both this conversation topic and their grip on the wall cracks. Instead, they reached for their signalscope and pointed it upwards:</p>
<p>“Hal,” they called out, “are you still there?”</p>
<p>Their radio picked up an almost simultaneous mixture of <i><span class=radio>“Firn! Hi again!”</span></i> and <i><span class=radio>“We can hear you loud and clear, Firn.”</span></i> The cadet repressed a tiny chuckle at the ground control’s enthusiasm.</p>
<p><span class=radio>“I must take it that you and Gabbro landed safely on this other island?”</span> Hornfels added immediately, still keeping some barely audible traces of worry and likely trying to pretend that they had not spent the whole time hoping for a crash-less day.</p>
<p><span class=radio>“You’ve found something interesting?”</span> Hal asked right after, voice brimming with hope and excitement.</p>
<p>“Hey, hey, one at a time,” Firn snickered. “Yes we made it there, and yes we’ve got some news — kinda disappointing, though. Gabbro’s statue is right in front of an airlock, and the room behind it should give a ton of info about how they were made, and maybe what they were for.”</p>
<p>The radio seemed to transmit what had to be a barely audible murmur of confusion, before Hal could be heard again: <span class=radio>“Wait, those are <i>good</i> news. What’s the catch?”</span></p>
<p>“Airlock’s broken. Gotta find another way in.”</p>
<p class=radio>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Talk to you later.”</p>
<p>Firn then put away the signalscope and readied their scout launcher. Sending one last glance at the broken but far too sturdy wall, they then scanned the rest of their surroundings down to the smallest branch of coral they could see, looking for something else to continue investigating. Alas, it appeared that there was nothing more to find on this beach which could be of any use.</p>
<p>“Come on,” they soon instructed to Gabbro, with a tilt of their head pointing towards what seemed to be a path up the cliff lined up with gravity crystals, and their feet soon following their own advice. “There’s got to be another entrance somewhere.”</p>
<p>With a heavy jump coming off with an audible <i>oomph</i> and a powerful upwards thrust of their jetpack which was completely unnecessary if Gabbro had anything to say about it, Firn soon landed on the vertical surface surrounding the nearest gravity crystal, then turned around briefly to insistently repeat their command, waiting for the other Hearthian to follow in their trail.</p>
<p>Both explorers cautiously followed the path in silence — or, well, almost in silence:</p>
<p>“New entry: Giant’s Deep. Statue isla̷͗ͅn̷̞͠ḋ̶͈̺ ”</p>
<p>If Gabbro had been startled by the unexpected words that were evidently not directed at them, they were even more surprised by the abrupt ending. Perking their head up towards Firn’s in a slight hurry, as theirs had been the voice to utter what they had just heard, they instantly noticed that the young cadet’s hand was tinkering with the base of their helmet’s aerial and that they had just turned off their radio; and when Gabbro gave a tentative tap on their shoulder, the hatchling’s reaction was to give them a dismissive wave and accelerate their pace. Their radio being turned off mid-sentence explained what they had just heard, and the body language along with the fact that Firn started walking away from them confirmed that it was intentional.</p>
<p class=vs>The elder astronaut’s curiosity was piqued. Walking closer nonetheless (if only because they were following the same narrow path anyway), listening in this time not through the radio, but through the thickness of two helmets and a stormy atmosphere, Gabbro could almost associate the movement of their lips with concise and specific words. They could almost catch a whole sentence, thinking that what Firn said must have been something along the lines of <i>“…used to lead inside the island.”</i></p>
<p>And then Firn raised the same hand to their helmet again. With the flick of a finger against the same button at the base of their aerial, their radio was turned back on; and along with the many connections it brought back, was the connection with their ship and the order to save the new file which had just been created. They gave a satisfied hum when their <span class=scaps>hud</span> displayed the words ‘<span class=scaps>ship log updated</span>.’</p>
<p class=vs>The elders and not-so-elders all had a lot of gripes with a lot of things regarding Firn’s general attitude; but one thing they could not ignore, and one of the main reasons that got them into the program along with their invaluable contribution in helping Hal make the Nomai translator a reality, was the fact that Firn was exceptionally thorough and methodical.</p>
<p>They were a sarcastic brat who questioned authority more often than they listened to their answers, they were dangerously reckless, they were obnoxiously stubborn; but when it was about exploring the outer wilds and piecing together the mysteries their solar system harbored, they were taking the matter with the utmost solemnity. Where Hearthian society had failed to teach them respect, the universe itself had by proving to them how small of a pebble they all were, floating in the vastness of a whole lot of nothing.</p>
<p>Now finished with their note-taking, Firn turned to them and gave a sheepish laugh. “My bad, I almost forgot to mute my transmitter. Didn’t want to bother you with my ramblings.”</p>
<p>“Turning off your radio is dangerous,” Gabbro warned, “even if it’s temporary. Why did you feel the need to do that?”</p>
<p>“Can’t risk having someone else speak through my comms while I’m editing,” they mumbled with a shrug, “that’d mess up the whole entry.” They marked a pause, noticing that the trail of gravity crystals had ended and led to an open path back to horizontality, and therefore to the regular definitions of up and down. With another jump and, again, far too much fuel being burned for such a tiny leap in Gabbro’s personal opinion, Firn landed on the exposed path and continued their walk. Then, they resumed: “Also, it helps me focus.”</p>
<p>Gabbro left the gravity crystal trail in turn, simply by stretching a laid-back leg away from the vertical path and planting it on the horizontal one, and then repeating those steps with their other one with just as much nonchalance. All the while, they gave a light hum and nod. “And then you turn it back on to send the file to your ship.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh. All I have to do after that is turn on the computer and profit.”</p>
<p>Gabbro blew an impressed whistle. “Slate sure got you spoiled with all those fancy gadgets.”</p>
<p>Firn’s laugh was this time an unrestrained bark of excitement and mock-offense. “Hey, the coding part was all me! Slate didn’t want to show me how they programmed the autopilot, and I’m pretty sure it’s ‘cause they were jealous, heh.”</p>
<p>They raised a surprised eyebrow. “Wait, really?”</p>
<p>“Yep! It was a bit last minute and they were reluctant at first, but in the end they let me include some work of mine for the ship log. Text-to-speech was a prototype upgrade I was thinking about for the translator, but when I offered Hal to use their voice for the database, they said it wasn’t necessary, so, <i>oh well</i>. Reversed the whole thing and got it added to my ship instead. Been wanting to make sure I’d be able to write log entries even when I have my hands full, and now that we’re here…” They let their tirade trail off and blend into a smug snicker full of pride. “Heh, I’m gonna have <i>so</i> much fun with that featu—”</p>
<p>Firn was not given the chance to finish their sentence.</p>
<p>It started with the wind picking up at once, sweeping them to the side with a violence far too fierce and sudden for them to resist. It was only thanks to their quick thinking in using their downward thrusters that Firn managed, for a few seconds at least, to maintain their feet glued to the ground and not fall over the cliff entirely. These same few seconds had them simultaneously busy with putting their scout launcher away in order to free their hands, but to their dismay, they had already been pushed too far from the rock wall to be able to reach for it and take a grip — not that there was much of a grip to take in the first place.</p>
<p><i>“Uh oh”</i> were the only words Gabbro uttered into their radio, both cryptic and unhelpful, as they realized the reason why neither of them had seen it coming: the large cyclone which was currently thinking about swallowing them whole had been treacherously coming to them from the other side of the island — a perfect blind spot.</p>
<p>Before Firn could process what was even happening, they fell to their knees as the ground shook and rose at high speed, feeling crushed under a doubled gravity which, because of the upwards acceleration, had been multiplied even further. Against their better judgement, Firn screamed.</p>
<p>“Firn! Buddy!”</p>
<p>Gabbro may as well have been coming up with actual advice by this point; but despite their efforts, Firn’s flattened and buzzing ears heard none of it, and with their four eyes shut tight, the hatchling was blind to the fact that they were trying to slowly crawl to their side and reach out for their hand. Gabbro was too slow for the latter step to be successful.</p>
<p>Wind turned to silence, green turned to black.</p>
<p class=vs>Going in an instant from quadrupled gravity to none, feeling solid ground evade their feet and hands and knees, seeing it grow smaller, then bigger and bigger, ready to collide with their face, Firn flailed about helplessly. Too disoriented to pay attention to the voice in their receiver, they only had a split second to finally notice Gabbro reaching out for their hand, only to immediately after see their faraway blurry figure get accidentally kicked in the ribs and sent flying dozens of meters away and up in the air by their own panicking limbs.</p>
<p>With a gasp of guilt and panic, Firn flared up their thrusters at full power to catch up after them, only to forget that during these few seconds, the gravity they had to fight against was no longer twice that of Timber Hearth, but falsely nonexistent — and further than this, that any momentum they were to gain from then on was not so easily subsided.</p>
<p>They collided with Gabbro, hard. With an <i>“Oomph”</i> and a <i>“Firn, wait—”</i> which entered one of Firn’s ears only to instantly come out the other, Gabbro was flung even further away in the process. In trying to catch up again and reach out to them with continuously growing panic and an equally continuous trail of <i>“Sorry!”</i>, Firn’s grip on the joystick controlling their jetpack came loose. In turning their head violently in order to find and catch it again, their whole body started rotating uncontrollably into the vast void of space.</p>
<p>And then, finally, Gabbro blasted their way to them with a single calculated thrust of minimal force, succeeding in slowing down enough to avoid collision this time, and grabbed their leg. In a matter of a few dozen seconds, both astronauts were back at eye level again, standing upright again relatively to each other, and…</p>
<p>…far up in orbit, at a high enough altitude to see Giant’s Deep’s curvature.</p>
<p>The island they had been investigating, briefly turned into a lift straight up to space, was nowhere to be seen. It had most likely already made its way back to the surface, back to floating like a buoy, following the whims and fancies of the planet’s flows and currents.</p>
<p class=vs>Gabbro brought a hand to the side of their helmet and, orienting their visor towards Giant’s Deep, they locked on to it… Yep, they were pretty far up.</p>
<p>Judging by the velocity displayed on their <span class=scaps>hud</span>, they had embarked on a very, very slow descent, following the nearby gravitational pull; but if Gabbro’s estimations were to be trusted and no island were to coincidentally come to them in the meantime, they would both have ample time to die through suffocation long before they would through colliding with the ocean. Maybe even twice over.</p>
<p>Gabbro clicked their tongue, reaching for their signalscope. “…Okay. Maybe we’re in a little bit of trouble.”</p>
<p>Firn turned their visor away from the sight of the planet and towards their face, eyes wide. “A&nbsp;<i><span class=scaps>little bit</span>!?</i>” they exploded.</p>
<p>“Tone it down, radio’s picking up your voice just fine.” They only needed to adjust the frequency, find where to aim, and… “Um. Hornfels? You still here?”</p>
<p>There were a few seconds of silence; but soon, the receiver crackled with static and worry. <span class=radio>“We can hear you, Gabbro, and I am not liking this tone. What happened?”</span></p>
<p>“Yeah, well…” the older astronaut sighed, trying to explain their predicament to a Hearthian who did not have the luxury of seeing what they were currently looking at. “Giant’s Deep has a lot of cyclones, you know? And they’re powerful enough to pull out entire islands right into space for a few moments. Happens sometimes.”</p>
<p>“Only <i>‘sometimes’</i>!?” Firn parroted with a deadpan look and a nearly hysterical shriek brimming with sarcasm. “I’ve been here for less than a half sunrise and the whole <i>planet</i> already kicked me out!”</p>
<p>Hal’s voice resonated nervously: <span class=radio>“I’m… I’m not sure I understand. You were kicked out of…? What’s going on?”</span></p>
<p>Judging from the volume of their voice slowly decreasing near the end, it seemed like they were gently pushed away from the ground control desk’s microphone. And indeed, Hornfels soon took over instead, tone sharp and straight to the point: <span class=radio>“Gabbro, just tell us where you are. What is your current position?”</span></p>
<p>“…About sixteen kilometers from the center of mass. Currently in orbit.”</p>
<p>With Giant’s Deep’s water surface standing on average at a radius of roughly five kilometers, this meant that this would be more than a whole ten kilometers drop. From this height and accounting for the increased gravity, even landing in water would likely be enough to cause at the very least a severe concussion; and being concussed while floating in the middle of a raging ocean was begging for the universe to end their life with slow and painful drowning, not even accounting for the chance of cyclones picking them up and flinging them around a few more times for good measure.</p>
<p>Hornfels let out a grunt filled with frustration and concern. <span class=radio>“Fuel and oxygen?”</span></p>
<p>There was a second of heavy silence. “Bad.”</p>
<p class=radio>“Gabbro. I want <i>numbers</i>.”</p>
<p>There was an inhale through Gabbro’s nose audible enough to make it through their transmitter. “Twenty-one percent fuel, fifty-three minutes oxygen,” they relented tensely. They knew they had forgotten something when leaving camp (well, one of two things, really, but only one of the two was because of their own negligence), and that something had been to refuel their jetpack. Turning their helmet towards their fellow astronaut, they gave an inquisitive nod: “Firn?”</p>
<p>Gabbro could almost hear the hatchling’s lips trembling before they spoke. “…S-six percent, forty-five minutes.”</p>
<p>A few seconds of muffled swearing crackled through the radio. Then:</p>
<p class=radio>“Stay right where you are. Await instructions.”</p>
<p>“Not much of a choice,” Gabbro shrugged before lowering their signalscope.</p>
<hr>
<p>To say that Hal was panicking would be an understatement.</p>
<p class=vs>The moment Hornfels had pressed a button likely meant to deafen (but not mute) their connection to Firn and Gabbro’s radios, the tall Hearthian started dashing around the observatory, looking at charts and more parts of the many screens and buttons on their dashboard, and Hal was struggling to find any place where they could stand and have their panic attack in silence without being an obstacle to their work.</p>
<p>There was nothing they could do. They hardly understood what was happening, Hornfels’ actions were swift and precise and full of a meaning that they had never seen or learned. Hal so desperately wanted to help, but they had no clue how; and with no purpose or knowledge to grasp, only fear remained.</p>
<p class=vs>Hornfels ran to the model of the solar system standing at the edge of the staircase, and pulling a measuring tape out of their pocket, they inched closer to the moving spheres and assessed some distances. The model had been crafted to be to scale, and thanks to the Deep Space Satellite and some quite brilliant work from Slate, the relative positions of each tiny replica were calculated to reflect those of the actual astral bodies in real time.</p>
<p>Sadly, the current alignments Hornfels could see were far from ideal. Both Timber Hearth and the Hourglass Twins were standing opposite to Giant’s Deep, as far away from it as they possibly could get — and with this, it was clear that they did not have enough time to even consider them as options.</p>
<p class=vs>Which left…</p>
<p>Well, the good news was, this planet was on the other hand as close to their target as it could possibly be.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hornfels brought a hand to rub their nose bridge and took a deep inhale. This was not going to be easy.</p>
<p>They stood up and swiftly turned to their dashboard, only to see a hatchling standing right next to the controls; without thinking, they started to call out for their help: “Hal, give me—” But the next second, their eyes met with their distraught and terrified face, and they remembered that the poor thing had no idea how any part of this apparatus worked. “Never mind, just let me through.”</p>
<p>Hal staggered away from the desk as Hornfels pounced on it, and with a few swift button presses, a connection was established with Brittle Hollow. Instantly, the calming notes of a banjo resonated in the room, instilling an unwelcome eeriness due to the unexpected contrast with the ambient feel of urgency.</p>
<p>“Ground Control to Riebeck,” they reached out with a surprisingly steady voice, “do you copy?”</p>
<p>The music’s volume slightly lowered and slowed down, but did not fully stop. Soon came a cheerful greeting: <span class=radio>“Oh, Hornfels! Hello!”</span></p>
<p>“I fear the circumstances are far from ideal, and we do not have much time,” they continued, trying to find the best way to summarize the situation as concisely as they could. “Gabbro and Firn are stranded in orbit around Giant’s Deep, with no ship or fuel, and we have barely forty minutes before they run out of oxygen.”</p>
<p>A timid, uninvited yelp went to complete the harmony of their tune, ending the melody on an abrupt note. <span class=radio>“A-a-and you want <i>me</i> to rescue them!? Hornfels, I’m sure we both want them to be <i>rescued</i>, not to end up with a third stranded astronaut! Where do I even land my ship? What if I c-<i>crash</i> into something somehow and kill them? Along with myself!?”</span></p>
<p>“Riebeck, you are <i>scared</i>, not <i>incompetent</i>,” Hornfels insisted gravely. “Neither Chert nor Esker could arrive before they start suffocating. Brittle Hollow is currently the closest planet to Giant’s Deep, you are the only one who can make it in time.”</p>
<p>There were more ruffling sounds. This time, none of them could be identified as a banjo string being plucked. <span class=radio>“O-okay. Okay. I’m— I’m coming. T-t-tell them to hang on tight. <span class=smol>…Ooh, why did I leave my ship on the south pole…</span>”</span> And as the sounds of quick pacing were picked up by the receiver, followed by a low gravity attempt at running, Riebeck added: <span class=radio>“I have a spare tank of oxygen here, and I think my ship has one or two more. Also fuel for their jetpacks. Just in case.”</span></p>
<p>“That should be more than enough,” Hornfels nodded. “Thank you, Riebeck.”</p>
<p class=radio>“But, Hornfels— H-how am I even going to find them? We can play in any atmosphere, but we still need at least <i>some</i> air, no? There’s nothing to play with if they’re in orbit! Can my signalscope even detect them?”</p>
<p>Hornfels bit their lip. Admittedly, they did not know the answer to that question, as they had yet to recall any occurrence where one of the travelers would attempt to play anywhere other than at their camp, safely sitting around a cozy fire burning in a well-maintained pocket of breathable air created by their good old pine trees.</p>
<p>“…We’ll figure something out. Just focus on making it to your ship as fast as you can.”</p>
<p><span class=radio>“G-got it.”</span> There were a few seconds of heavy breathing, likely caused by the archeologist’s hurried pace. Then: <span class=radio>“Wish me luck. We’re all going to need it.”</span></p>
<hr>
<p class=vs>Firn looked down at the tumultuous clouds twirling below their feet from afar. The sight sure was terrifying, albeit quite impressively beautiful, too.</p>
<p>Still, aesthetic was not what the young cadet had been looking for.</p>
<p>“We’ve still got <i>some</i> fuel left. Can’t we just… try giving a small boost downwards and landing on Giant’s Deep again? That’ll be a big plunge, but it sounds better than staying in orbit. Both our ships are down there anyway.”</p>
<p>Gabbro crossed their arms and sighed.</p>
<p>“If you want to gamble and think we’ll somehow be lucky enough to land <i>in water</i> rather than directly crash on land, to not be taken by <i>another</i> cyclone right after, to <i>somehow</i> be close enough to my camp so we can swim to the trees and refill, <i>without</i> using our jetpacks, and <i>before</i> we suffocate,” they detailed, raising one finger at each condition necessary for their survival to be even remotely conceivable (and uncrossing their arms as soon as they realized that one hand would not be enough), “then yes. Maybe. That’s one plan, I guess, but I really don’t like our chances.”</p>
<p>Firn gave a sarcastic huff. “And you think we have better chances staying up here till our oxygen runs out?”</p>
<p>Before Gabbro could respond, the sound of static finally came back through their receivers. <span class=radio>“Riebeck is on their way, their ship should be in view in about thirty minutes,”</span> Hornfels’ voice soon rang out sharply. <span class=radio>“Stay put and focus on saving your resources.”</span></p>
<p class=vs>Firn’s arms dropped to their sides as they simply stared in disappointed shock. The visor made it impossible to see their face, but Gabbro’s head tilt in their direction made it quite clear that they just <i>had</i> to be giving them a smug, patronizing expression.</p>
<p><i>‘And that’s how you do it the Gabbro way, rookie,’</i> Firn could picture in their mind. Ah, yes, of course, the Gabbro way: making others do all the work in your stead.</p>
<p>“So— are we <i>really</i> just gonna— stay like this and do <i>nothing!?</i>”</p>
<p>“It’s just thirty minutes, buddy, it’s not the end of the world.”</p>
<p class=vs>Not the end of the world, but definitely the end of their patience.</p>
<p>There <i>had</i> to be something to do, and they would get that something done — if only out of childish spite.</p>
<p>With a sudden flash of inspiration, Firn gasped: “Gabbro, can’t you use your flute for Riebeck to pick up on?”</p>
<p>Gabbro raised their hands and showed their palms, both empty. “What flute? You didn’t let me take it when we left camp.”</p>
<p>After a long second of silence, Firn momentarily felt a great urge to slam their helmet against an open palm. Before they could act upon it, however, the full gravity of the situation fell upon them; and thus, only their chilling remorse was expressed. “…Right. Sorry. Not my brightest moment.”</p>
<p>And so, defeated, the cadet looked down in shame and regret.</p>
<p>Their first trip should have been exciting. Their first trip should have been all about exploring space and translating words that no Hearthian had ever read before.</p>
<p>Their first trip should have been about proving that they were <i>competent</i>.</p>
<p>But they had barely gotten started on solving the mystery of the statues, and the planet itself had laughed in their face.</p>
<hr>
<p>It was a well known fact amongst the village that Firn was neither one to contemplate, nor one to surrender. Their four eyes may have been spending the time staring down at Giant’s Deep, their fingers may have been spending the time twitching in impatience, their mouth may have been spending the time trying to chase away all the sass their brain was coming up with, knowing full well that Gabbro was hardly the Hearthian to give satisfying reactions to it.</p>
<p class=vs>But this was time spent bubbling with rage and intent to fight against the boredom and frustration to be <i>asked</i> to stay in place while the <i>adults</i> would fix their mistake, and this was time spent thinking more and more that, after this, no astronaut would trust them to ever go back to space and not turn it into disaster.</p>
<p>This was time spent getting progressively more convinced that, somehow, against the odds, they could still fix this. That they <i>had</i> to fix this.</p>
<p>And so, after a dozen minutes or so which felt like so much longer, Firn spied with their four little eyes… a change. A solution, in the form of a strange apparatus.</p>
<p>They recognized the shape. No Hearthian had figured out what it was, for no astronaut had ever landed on it before, but there was no mistaking it: this massive rocket-like structure was the enigmatic satellite that Outer Wilds Ventures had long spotted orbiting Giant’s Deep.</p>
<p>It was hovering close, less than a kilometer away below their feet, with its orbit faster than theirs by a small margin.</p>
<p>The window of opportunity was small; but only a fool would refuse to take it.</p>
<p>Firn seized Gabbro’s arm without warning and instantly pressed the joystick of their jetpack to blast downwards and to the side, carefully calculating their trajectory.</p>
<p>Gabbro protested loudly, because of course they would; Firn ignored them entirely, just as much as they ignored the tiny message soon displaying at the top of their visor — some kind of warning ending with the word ‘propellant,’ but their eyes were already too focused on their target to pay it any mind.</p>
<p>Less than a minute passed by, and Firn could touch with satisfaction a transparent, broken wall slashed in its center, and see a blurry mess of debris floating on the other side. Only then, as they knew that their velocity was aligned with that of the eons old satellite, did Firn finally pay attention to the astronaut they had dragged along with them; and by paying attention to them, they rather interrupted their objections with a long-overdue, but smug and prideful explanation:</p>
<p>“See? I gave Riebeck a landmark to see from afar! I’m sure this thing’s big enough for their ship to be able to lock on to it too, perhaps even land on it.” Reaching for their signalscope and pointing it outwards, they asserted proudly: “You heard that, Hornfels? I found us a better spot to wait on. Riebeck will have a much easier time finding us now.”</p>
<p>Hornfels sounded like they were choking, and their equally suffocating sentence was far less constructed than was usual for them. <span class=radio>“You did <i>what!?</i>”</span></p>
<p>“That huge thing that orbits Giant’s Deep!” they explained cheerfully. “It’s big, it’s visible from far away, there might even be a way to land a ship on it, and it’s orbiting Giant’s Deep. Hardly changes Riebeck’s plan, it just makes their job easier.”</p>
<p>Turning to the other stranded astronaut to their side, Firn felt like it was their turn to be smug.</p>
<p>Instead, Gabbro’s inexpressive helmet stared right into them, eerily still. “Buddy,” they scolded with what sounded like frigid terror, “your <i>oxygen</i>.”</p>
<p>They froze. Tilting their eyes to the top left corner of their vision, they looked at the tiniest chart displayed on their visor’s screen:</p>
<p>Nineteen minutes left.</p>

<div class=chp id=ch4_1><h1>Chapter 4</h1><h2>Probing for Clues in Orbit</h2><hr>
<p>Nineteen minutes left.</p>
<p>Firn could hear their own breathing more than they ever had before. Had it always been so loud? Had the cloud of condensation forming and vanishing on the glass always been there? Had that glass always been so thin and close to their face?</p>
<p>“Buddy, you’ll want to calm down if you want to have enough oxygen left by the time Riebeck arrives,” Gabbro advised with an unusually serious tone.</p>
<p>Firn gritted their teeth with a huff. “I <i>know</i> that, I’m not a <i>rookie!</i>” they shouted, taking full offense to what they were certain sounded patronizing.</p>
<p class=vs>But then, they realized that they were panting, and that knowing was not enough to actually apply their knowledge to practice. It was now as if they could feel their oxygen run out of their throat, all of it wasted by this stupid body who was breathing too fast to make any good use of it.</p>
<p>They were not even able to follow the most basic rule, the very first one Gossan had taught them — the one about <i>staying calm</i> under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, they were a rookie. They were just a rookie, they were on their very first launch day, and <i>they were about to die</i>.</p>
<p>“Oh geez. <i>Ooh</i> geez.” Firn grabbed their helmet, as if their hands could pass through the visor and block their mouth, as if this could somehow prevent them from hyperventilating. They had just enough sense left into them to remember that removing it was about the <i>last</i> thing they wanted to do under the current circumstances.</p>
<p>Gabbro seized both of their shoulders, giving a gentle but decisive shake. “Buddy. Look at me. Deep breaths,” they instructed, taking one themself as example. “Deep… breaths. There’s this meditation technique, it’s good for minimizing your oxygen consumption. Follow my lead.”</p>
<p>Firn, miraculously, heard and understood these words. Raising their eyes to look out of the confined space defined by their helmet — which they were certain appeared to be shrinking, with an ever smaller window and a growing darkness surrounding it — they managed to catch the sight of another helmet, and through that other visor, barely visible but still glinting with care, were four other eyes looking back.</p>
<p>Deep breaths. They were asking for deep breaths. Focusing on the breathing which crackled through their radio receiver, rather than on their own, Firn slowly managed to synchronize their rhythm.</p>
<p>“You’re doing good, keep at it,” Gabbro assured calmly. “Close your eyes, forget about everything else. You’ll see, rescue will be here before you know it.”</p>
<p>Closing their eyes felt like a relief, as they had somewhat started to sting – as if the air itself was starting to eat at them, trying to solve their growing emptiness by consuming anything it could.</p>
<p>Forgetting was also something they did gladly, without question: forgetting that they were in outer space, forgetting that the sound of their breath against their visor was becoming uncomfortably lower and slower, forgetting that, as their oxygen resources were getting closer to depletion, the air pressure inside their suit was automatically lowering in turn – a last resort feature meant to favor survival with possible health consequences to a faster death.</p>
<p>The rhythm of Gabbro’s breathing had something mesmerizingly soothing to it. With more and more ease as time flew by, Firn let themself lose everything to it; and it was not long before their consciousness faded, letting their mind doze off and wander to temporary nothingness.</p>
<hr>
<p>Riebeck had every right to be exceptionally proud of themself; alas, the urgency of the situation combined with their own fear of space and failure alike, even after they had succeeded, would forever prevent them from realizing it.</p>
<p class=vs>Gabbro had told Hornfels, and Hornfels had relayed the information to them: they were to search for the two stranded astronauts not by blindly looking for two minuscule black dots standing in front of a roaring green scenery, but by landing on the much larger device orbiting it, and then by looking for, apparently, a part of it made of glass which had a large horizontal hole in its center.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this made the task of finding the two far easier, as the contraption soon became visible even as their ship was standing some fifty kilometers away from the core of Giant’s Deep. On the other, this made the likelihood of crashing into something tangible infinitely larger.</p>
<p>Yet, to the surprise of nobody but themself, landing had been smooth and uneventful — in large part thanks to what Riebeck had soon recognized with unexpected amazement to be a Nomai landing pad in perfect working condition.</p>
<p>At first, as soon as they opened the hatch and jumped out of their ship, Riebeck looked down and into the hole at the center of it: but all they found was a closed Nomai airlock pointing outwards, sign that the astronauts in need of rescue were definitely not waiting on the other side of it.</p>
<p class=vs>Riebeck called once, tentatively, and was immensely relieved to hear Gabbro responding — proof that they were finally close enough from each other to be within their respective radios’ proximity radius.</p>
<p>Gabbro’s subsequent indications were extremely helpful in guiding them to their exact location; and so, with two tanks of oxygen and fuel under each arm, and a relatively short yet far too long itinerary of spacewalk to carefully and anxiously go through, the archeologist slowly made their way across the structure and towards the side their friends were waiting from.</p>
<p class=vs>As they approached, Riebeck noticed more and more evidence that the structure was of Nomai origin, and part of them pondered why no one had ever wanted to explore it; but it was not long before they reasoned that only one astronaut could possibly have been bold enough to attempt it, and… said astronaut had disappeared before they could set their mind on anything other than a planet. The planets had been big and full of discoveries enough on their own, with even so little as the Hanging City being far more to explore than Riebeck could have ever imagined before they could catch sight of it for themself.</p>
<p>Well, that and the fact that the only entrance they had found so far was a closed Nomai airlock. No Hearthian had yet figured out how to open those: it was clear that the spheres embedded within those stone rails were involved… But just like Hornfels had (according to Hal) spent sleepless weeks trying to pry open a Nomai statue’s eyes to no avail, never had Riebeck succeeded in getting those spheres to move either. Admittedly, it was in great part because they refused to put in too much force into those eons old structures for fear of breaking their mechanisms… But still. Riebeck had long accepted with disappointment that those airlocks might as well be solid, impassable walls.</p>
<p>“Riebeck, over here. Look down and to your left.”</p>
<p>Startling at first at the sound of Gabbro’s voice suddenly brightening their tone, they soon did as asked, and caught sight of an astronaut waving at them from about fifty meters away.</p>
<p>Gabbro was holding something under their arm… Oh dear. Firn’s body looked limp.</p>
<p>“O-oh no! Am I too late!?”</p>
<p>“Relax, they’re still breathing,” Gabbro reassured with a soothing voice, but still with some underlying tones of concern which urged Riebeck to hurry. “Showed them some meditation trick. They’re in it <i>deep</i>, who would’ve thought that they’d be so good at it with all the, you know. Firn-ness.”</p>
<p>Gabbro decided against specifying out loud that the lowered oxygen pressure inside their suit most likely contributed a lot, and might even be the actual culprit responsible for knocking them out the moment their adrenaline rush had started to recede. Riebeck was bound to panic at the reminder, and the last thing all three astronauts needed in this moment was a Riebeck trembling too much to properly control their own limbs.</p>
<p class=vs>Riebeck finally made their way down to their level, and Gabbro instantly reached out for the tanks under their right arm in order to free them of the voluminous burden.</p>
<p>Riebeck tried to reach out for Firn’s oxygen tank, but the fact that they only had one free hand, that Gabbro was holding them around the waist like a sandbag, and that they both had to remain mindful to not let the lack of relative gravity distance them from the Nomai structure, made the task far more difficult than it had any right to be.</p>
<p>With a panicked sigh, Riebeck looked around them, trying to find at least some way to get a better grip on the alien space station; and after a few seconds, their eyes lit up. They immediately pointed at a dim and diffused light emanating from the floor on the other side of the broken window.</p>
<p>“Gabbro, I th-think those are gravity panels,” they instructed. “Let’s go there, it’ll be much easier to refill when we’re not in zero-g.”</p>
<p>Gabbro followed their gaze, then raised an intrigued eyebrow. “Huh. First time I hear of those. Is that floor made of ground up gravity crystals—”</p>
<p>“G-<i>Gabbro</i>.”</p>
<p>“—Right. Coming.”</p>
<hr>
<p class=vs>Firn was awoken by the sound and sensation of oxygen rushing into their helmet in a rapid burst, slightly but suddenly increasing the air pressure and making their head and ears buzz in turn.</p>
<p>Faster than their mind could think, their chest jerked forward as they desperately gasped for air, lungs feeling far emptier than they ever imagined they could possibly get — only to instantly so, <i>so</i> happily find something to fill them with again.</p>
<p class=vs>In the instant when their lucidity came back, somewhere between two loud and throat-wrenching coughs, Firn made their mind in silence, forming an opinion which would never leave it due to both limited time and personal pride:</p>
<p>This felt like coming back to life.</p>
<p>Multiple hands came on their chest and shoulders, gently but firmly pushing them downward, and they realized that, somehow, they had been lying on what appeared to be solid ground. Their now open eyes went from blurry and dispersed to focused, and soon locked on to the sight of a flashlight uncomfortably directed straight into their eyes, and of two astronauts bent over their face in worry — worry which instantly turned to two sighs of intense relief.</p>
<p>“You made it, buddy,” Gabbro complimented with a calm pat on their shoulder. “You can thank Riebeck for literally saving your life. We both owe them a big one.” They briefly looked to the side with an amused snort, before adding: “And, only you this time, you also owe a certain someone a <i>big</i> apology.”</p>
<p><span class=radio>“<i>No stunts</i>, Firn!”</span> came out the hysterically sobbing disembodied voice of Hal, and Firn realized that one of Gabbro’s hands was holding a signalscope. <span class=radio>“You <i>promised!</i>”</span></p>
<p><span class=radio>“Firn,”</span> Hornfels scolded with a stern but immensely relieved tone, <span class=radio>“you had better make the most of your time up here while you still can, because the moment you come back to Timber Hearth, you are grounded until further notice.”</span></p>
<p>“But—” they started whining, only to get interrupted by their throat demanding another cough, “that’s not fair! The cyclone wasn’t my fault!”</p>
<p>“The constant waste of jetpack fuel, the failure to keep an eye on your resource levels, the disregard for orders, the lack of warning and refusal to ask for ground control’s approval when you took your own reckless initiatives, and the whole dragging us here against what everyone else had planned totally were, though,” Gabbro retorted with a light shrug and nonchalant tone while, again, raising a finger for each instance being listed, and sticking the signalscope between their upper arm and chest when their second hand became necessary to continue the count.</p>
<p class=vs>Firn decided not to mention that, in part because of the surrounding darkness, and in other part because Riebeck’s torchlight flashing into their face was not making that darkness any easier to see through, they were absolutely not able to see most of their fingers anyway.</p>
<p>They did, however, make a mental note to themself that having your torchlight directly attached to the side of your helmet had to have a ton of advantages, but that social interactions with your fellow travelers were certainly not one of them.</p>
<p>“S-so now, if you don’t mind, after we’re done exploring we’re going home. And staying on breathable, non-brittle ground, for a while,” Riebeck stated with a strangely calm voice — albeit calm with some form of hollow light-headedness. “Gabbro can take my ship if you want to bring yours back later and– and risk <i>your</i> lives again, <i>without me</i>.” They heaved a few pained sighs, before lowering their tone: “…No, for real though, please d-don’t risk your lives like this again. My heart can’t take it.”</p>
<p>Gabbro gave a quiet and amused chuckle, but then turned to them and raised an incredulous eyebrow, lowering the signalscope in the process. “…Wait, ‘done exploring’? I thought we’d get to your ship straight away.”</p>
<p>Riebeck waved their hands in big circles, looking up with excitement (and therefore finally moving their flashlight away from Firn’s face and towards literally any other target, to their own relief) and starting to pace giddily. “Gabbro, just <i>look</i> around you! Those are Nomai ruins! While we’re here, we might as well— W-we even have Firn’s translator, now! Who <i>wouldn’t</i> take the opportunity? My ship is right outside, we’re all refueled, a-and—” Their sentence trailing off, they suddenly stopped and lowered their arms sheepishly, eyeing both astronauts and putting a stop to the chiaroscuro’s eerie dance on eons old debris. “Y-you’re both doing okay, right? You don’t need urgent medical help, do you?”</p>
<p>Now that both astronauts had given them enough space to do so, Firn sat up, hiding their thankfully quieting coughs as best they could. Eyes lighting up with curiosity, they took a second to quizzically pat the floor which they had been laid upon and was dimly glowing with the radiation of artificial gravity; then, after searching for and switching on their own flashlight, they stood up and illuminated one by one the floating debris around them, recognizing them to be unmistakably Nomai architecture.</p>
<p>A huge grin now plastered on their face, they raised their head towards the archeologist. “Totally fine and ready for another lap,” they assured cheerfully, only losing their smile when their chest once again tried to force out another cough and they struggled to silence it. “I’m all for exploring the place too. Totally was part of the plan when I led us here, actually.”</p>
<p>Gabbro squinted at them with a tired, deadpan look. “…It absolutely was not.”</p>
<p>“Was too,” Firn pouted. “Secondary objective. Totally would’ve spent the time waiting for Riebeck taking a look around if I…”</p>
<p>“…If you hadn’t forgotten that your resources aren’t endless,” Gabbro sighed, rolling their upper eyes. “Alright. Fair enough.”</p>
<p>Taking another quick second to have a better look, they noticed that Firn’s chest was slightly trembling in small outbursts, and they realized that the real reason why they had let their own sentence trail off had been most likely because they were trying to repress another coughing fit.</p>
<p>Frowning, they added: “…And, yeah, a visit to Porphy’s probably wouldn’t hurt either. Even if they just end up giving you some herbs or something.”</p>
<p>The young cadet annoyingly waved them off, all the while trying to fight against their own crying chest. “I’m <i>fine</i>,” they insisted with a too little too raspy voice.</p>
<p>“No offense, but it sounds like your lungs are trying to climb out of your mouth, pal.”</p>
<p>“I can wait till we’ve explored at <i>least</i> this place!” they groaned stubbornly. Then, turning a more sheepish face and probably forgetting that the sight of their puppy eyes was going to be hidden by the surrounding darkness and their visor alike: “<i>Please</i>. For Riebeck.”</p>
<p>Gabbro snorted. “For Riebeck,” they parroted. “Totally not because you’re trying to drag on your last moments of freedom in space even if it could kill you.”</p>
<p>Firn crossed their arms and grunted. “It’s <i>not</i> gonna kill me, I’m not <i>that</i> dumb. I would’ve said it if I thought it was that bad.” And even if it weren’t for their own sake, they could never do that to Hal either, anyway. <span class=smol>…Not again. Not on purpose.</span></p>
<p>Gabbro’s eyes were raised to the ceiling as they shook their head and sighed in disbelief; but they decided to drop the matter, hoping that the fact that Firn’s coughs had started to be less frequent and quieter was an encouraging sign that, indeed, they did not seem to be aggravating their case.</p>
<p class=vs>Instead, their attention was soon overtaken by an orange and purple glint radiating off something small amongst the floating debris above their heads, and they squinted.</p>
<p class=vs>This kind of light was… strange and foreign to be sure. Vaguely familiar too, somehow, but for the most part, it gave them nothing but the gut feeling that something was fundamentally different with it.</p>
<p class=vs>It felt… unnatural. ‘Unnatural’ not in the sense that its source’s Nomai origins were artificial, but rather ‘unnatural’ in the sense that its… <i>destination</i>, somehow, was the true unnatural element.</p>
<p>Perhaps mystical, or spiritual even, felt like the proper words to describe it, they pondered.</p>
<p>Looking to their side, they found that Riebeck had for the past minute or so completely abandoned Firn and them to their argument, and had instead been fully focused and invested in studying every squared millimeter of the room with blissful joy, slowed down by nothing but the limitations of what their flashlight could reach. By now, they seemed to have stopped near a pair of waist-high pillars standing at the center of what seemed to be a squared cavity in the middle of the room, appearing utterly fascinated by the whole setting.</p>
<p class=vs>Raising their head again at the strange glowing item they had noticed, Gabbro jumped high enough to evade the floor’s artificial gravity, then pushed around a few unrelated tree pots and pieces of broken stone before they could take hold of it, and push their way back to the ground.</p>
<p>In passing, they also made a mental note that Firn could benefit quite a lot from learning that navigating in varying gravitational fields did not always require the use of a jetpack. But that one would have to be for later.</p>
<p>“Hey, Riebeck,” they called out while looking for the tip of their flashlight, then landing next to them and handing out their new find, “that thing looks important.”</p>
<p>Riebeck lowered their helmet with curiosity and bathed both the item and its discoverer’s hands in the light of their torch; then, they lit up after a few seconds and reached out for it with a pair of shaking hands, gasping in excitement. “A projection stone! I– At least I <i>think</i> that’s how the Nomai called them in their writings…? I’ve always wondered how they worked, and now— Oh stars, I can’t believe we might actually be able to find out!”</p>
<p>Firn walked up to them both, pointing their own light and staring at the flat stone, then up at the place where they had seen Gabbro take it. “What made you think it ‘looked important’? Anything in here could be worth taking a look at, but you pushed away a lot of other stuff around it without even looking. You didn’t even…” With their sentence trailing off, the cadet soon squinted dubiously. “Gabbro, do you even <i>have</i> a flashlight?”</p>
<p>“…I may have forgotten it at my camp,” they shrugged nonchalantly. “But in a way, that made it easier to find, I guess. It wasn’t that hard to tell apart from the rest, with it glowing in the dark and all.”</p>
<p>Following their words, silence fell for a few tense moments. Riebeck eyed them, then the stone, then Gabbro again. So did Firn, except they did not look back up, and instead crossed their arms with a silent and dubitative hum before raising a hand to tinker with the side of their helmet.</p>
<p>Just when Gabbro was about to ask what the awkward silence was for, Riebeck broke it with a cluelessly dismissive shrug: “Well, I guess it stopped glowing when you picked it up.”</p>
<p class=vs>From beneath their visor, Gabbro’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion. It was harder to see with Riebeck’s flashlight illuminating it from up close, but that stone plate’s symbol and middle slice were <i>clearly</i> luminescent.</p>
<p>…But, oh well. Whatever. This day had been long enough as it was, so they decided that arguing was not worth the effort.</p>
<p class=vs>Considering the fact that Riebeck seemed to have already forgotten the matter anyway, Gabbro thought they might as well stand back, take a break, and leave them to their own devices, while they would in the meanwhile both relax and ponder this new mystery in silence. Turning away from the square cavity and looking at the rest of the room, they soon spotted…</p>
<p>Well, they did not fail to notice that another similar-looking and similarly glowing stone was sitting horizontally on something which appeared to be slightly above knee-height, and upon calmly making their way to it, they soon saw their guess confirmed: the structure that this stone was standing on turned out to be, indeed, a bench. They sat comfortably, thinking that they would warn the others about that second projection stone later, once they would be done having their fun with the first one.</p>
<p>Firn had kept a distracted eye on Gabbro at first, but lost interest after a few seconds. Instead, they raised their head to give an inquisitive nod towards Riebeck, nudging them to share their knowledge: “So… A ‘projection stone,’ you say. Any idea what those are for?”</p>
<p>“Hasn’t Hal told you anything? They helped me translate a few writings that mentioned them,” Riebeck started with mild confusion… only to realize that, most likely, even if they had, Firn simply had not been paying attention at the time.</p>
<p class=vs>It truly was a shame, but aside from Hal, Hornfels, and themself… Not that many Hearthians even were all that interested in the Nomai to begin with. Slate technically was ‘interested’ in the Nomai, but it was far more because they were interested in getting their hands on scraps of their technology so they could find out in how many ways duct-taping them to wood and thrusters could lead to cool-looking explosions.</p>
<p>They were quite certain that Firn was interested in the Nomai as well, though it was indisputable that their interest was not nearly as profound as theirs or Hal’s. If Riebeck had to take a guess, it was likely that though Firn had been there for most conversations revolving around Hal’s musings and research, they might have spent a lot of that time tuning out whenever Hal became too little too invested and would go into tangents about linguistics and the intricacies of the Nomai language, only to end up accidentally not listening when the topic would switch to finds they would have wanted to hear about in the process.</p>
<p>They sighed with audible disappointment. “Alright. From what Hal and I managed to translate, projection stones seemed to be meant to connect two different locations for instantaneous communication — which means that they can’t do anything on their own.” Then, as they pointed an excited finger and the beam of their torchlight towards the double pillar by their side, they felt an overjoyed grin expand on their face: “They need to be paired with another one that would be linked to our current location, and I believe this right here is one way to use it!”</p>
<p>“It does seem to fit in the hole,” Firn shrugged jokingly as they looked down at the flat dent present on the top of one of the two pillars, and compared it with the flat stone carried by the other astronaut’s hands.</p>
<p>Riebeck nodded, helmet jumping up and down in a blur. “I know! And– and look at this!” They pointed at the simple motif carved on top of the other pillar: “This one can’t be removed, so I suppose this symbol here is meant to represent our current location.”</p>
<p>Firn hummed pensively. “Two hexagons branching off… and the stone you’re holding only has the first one. Are those Nomai words?”</p>
<p>“No, they don’t look like any words I know,” Riebeck replied with a shake of their head. “I believe they’re rather meant to be pictograms representing the locations they’re related to… Even though I have no idea what one or two connected hexagons could be for. Are we standing inside some kind of ‘Space Station Number Two’ and there would be a ‘Number One’ somewhere else?” Eyes widening, they gave a loud gasp and bent down to meet the young cadet at eye level and send them a thrilled look sparkling with delight. “O-oh, oh, oh stars– W-what if that ‘Number One’ could be the other station orbiting the sun!?”</p>
<p>“Well, there’s only one way to find out,” Firn quickly stated with an amused and curious chuckle, before they snatched Riebeck’s arm and guided it until the projection stone was placed just a centimeter above what had to be its intended place. Grinning, they looked up and asked teasingly: “Ready?”</p>
<p>Despite not appreciating the breach of privacy and controlling gesture, Riebeck decided not to complain. Instead, their fingers trembled with trepidation as their grip on the stone wavered and tightened in turn, on and off. “Ooh, am I!” they exclaimed all the while, before they finally managed to control their tremors and fit the eons old artifact inside its intended cavity, with both care and purpose.</p>
<p>Just a few seconds later, and both Hearthians realized that they were, in fact, very much not ready. After all, out of all things that could have happened, what did occur was entirely beyond the scope of their imagination.</p>
<p class=vs>It had started in a quite encouraging and exciting way: both pillars rotated and twisted in order to connect the two projection stones, a motion which was simultaneously entirely within the realm of their expectations, and yet still very much impressive and awe-inspiring to witness firsthand.</p>
<p>Neither, however, had predicted the sudden eruption of this strange, dark and viscous liquid, menacingly emerging from the base of the two pillars and rapidly rushing for their feet.</p>
<p>Firn jumped back with a yelp and flared up their jetpack by instinct, escaping at once both this unexpected threat and the reach of the artificial gravity. The few layers of alien slime which had taken hold on to their legs instantly stopped climbing up, instead going still at once, then rapidly receding back down to the bottom of their boots and, in one long drooping filament, eerily finding its way back into what had become a small black pond.</p>
<p>Riebeck was not so lucky. In an instant, their entire suit was submerged, to the extent that even the powerful torchlight’s beam originating from the side of their helmet appeared fully extinguished, and their transmitter did not fail to share with the two other astronauts their terrified scream — a scream which, to make matters worse, soon died down inexplicably.</p>
<p class=vs>Gabbro jumped out of their seat and ran to the edge, not daring to come any closer but still trying to think of ways to help. Firn, still floating above and amongst the debris and pointing their torchlight at their darkened shape, called their name in panic.</p>
<p>Riebeck’s silhouette, entirely covered yet still fully recognizable, went from flailing about in horror, to freezing in place, before slowly lowering their arms in silence.</p>
<p>Just as Firn was starting to think that this awful substance must have sneaked its way through their suit somehow and fully immobilized them by force, if not entirely smothered them, Riebeck turned their head around, then their whole body, in what seemed to be a mixture between slowly and surprisingly receding fear, intense confusion, and what seemed to be a growing sense of wonder.</p>
<p>“Uh… Gabbro? Firn? Are you two still here?” were the first questions they seemed to successfully come up with, if only because they felt like they <i>probably</i> needed to let their two friends know that, if those were their first words, and if their tone was calm enough, then perhaps the situation was not as horrifying as it first appeared.</p>
<p>“I can hear you,” Gabbro responded with a voice which wavered just enough to know that, for Gabbro standards, they were absolutely not calm. “Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Yeah, that was really freaky, but– uh, it didn’t leak inside the suit, at least. I can’t see you, though—”</p>
<p>“Riebeck, I’d be surprised if you could see <i>anything</i> right now,” Firn deadpanned with far less audible confidence and sass than they had originally intended.</p>
<p>“—No no no, that’s the thing!” they countered, head shaking and arms waving horizontally with vehemence. “I still see this room, you’re just not in it! Or… No, wait, I think that could be… a <i>different</i> room? …Y-yeah! Yeah, that’s a different room, it just looks <i>very</i> similar. Except that one doesn’t seem broken at all, everything’s on the ground and not, uh, all smashed and floating in zero-g. It also looks like it’s lit up, too.”</p>
<p>“But you didn’t move from <i>here</i>, though, did you?” Gabbro asked prudently – by this point, they were admittedly unsure whether this question was meant to be rhetorical or genuine.</p>
<p>Riebeck’s helmet slowly rose up, as they let a fist fall into the palm of their other hand and their radio transmitted a gasp of realization. “Of course!” they exclaimed, “This is how they could connect multiple people across two entirely different places! Th-this was far more advanced than just radio, they had– they had <i>visual</i> means to communicate in real time! A-and even more than <i>just</i> visual, oh stars, this is— Th-this is incredible…!”</p>
<p>Firn gave a low pensive hum. After a few seconds, they reached out for their scout launcher, aimed directly at the pool, and fired, their projectile landing right next to Riebeck. In an instant, the liquid seemed to detect its presence and devour it, defying the local gravity just to ensure that not a squared millimeter of its surface would be left in sight. Soon after, Riebeck turned around and looked down, stepping back in surprise with a small yelp—</p>
<p>“So you can see it?” Firn called out in excitement. “Don’t worry, that’s just my scout,” they soon added for clarification.</p>
<p>“O-oh! Oh. Y-yeah, it’s… I mean, it’s more like I can see its <i>shape</i>, but it’s still covered in…” Riebeck paused for a few seconds, pondering a few hypotheses, then decided to share the most likely one: “…Actually, I think it’s more like I see the liquid taking its shape. And… <i>my</i> shape too. All the way there, to the other location. Th-that must be how the communication could be two-ways, I guess? The Nomai would step in here and the projection stones would– w-well, <i>project</i> a reflection of their movements in another pool in the other location? Even though they never actually moved there?”</p>
<p>“Huh.” Gabbro raised an eyebrow, unsure whether they should feel amazed or appalled. “That’s… weird. And interesting. But mostly weird.”</p>
<p>Firn repeatedly pressed a few buttons on their launcher, taking a few photos; but soon, they frowned and deflated, cursing under their breath. “Seems like it only captures the goo,” they stated with a disappointed grunt before recalling their scout.</p>
<p class=vs>They hesitated for a few moments, but eventually decided to reluctantly push their way down, let the gravity panels’ reach pull them to the ground, and land in the pool themself. They tensed up as the viscous liquid reached for them, surrounding and covering every part of their suit with a thin but tight layer; but contrary to what they would have expected at first, the substance exposed a quite limited resistance to their movements.</p>
<p class=vs>In a matter of seconds, their helmet’s visor was covered in turn; and despite the fact that they knew what to expect this time, the impression of the darkness somehow becoming translucent – yet also not <i>really</i> translucent, since translucence would rather imply that the landscape they would be offered to see would be the one they were truly standing in, rather than one located somewhere else entirely – still took them aback.</p>
<p>The first thing Firn could notice, aside from what Riebeck had described, was the Riebeck-shaped pile of liquid standing by their side, which soon turned to stare back for a short moment, before going back to gazing and gawking at everything else.</p>
<p>They could no longer see them, but Firn still remembered where the third astronaut was supposed to be standing relative to their current position. And so, they turned around and placed their hands on their hips jokingly: “You’re not coming, Gabbro?”</p>
<p>The Hearthian in question did not bother shaking their head, knowing that they would not see it, and instead went back to sit on the bench, arms crossed. “No thanks. You can have fun without me.”</p>
<p>Also, they sort of wanted to ponder whether it was worrying or fortunate that, since both torchlights were currently muffled by the creepy liquid and leaving the entire room in close to total darkness save for the sunlight reflected by the upper atmosphere of Giant’s Deep, the only reason they had been able to find their bench again in the first place was thanks to the weird totally-glowing-yet-absolutely-not-glowing Nomai stone which just so happened to have been conveniently sitting on it for perhaps the past few hundred millennia.</p>
<p>One thing which Gabbro could far more easily define as unfortunate was the fact that the young cadet was not deterred yet. “What, scared to take a dip with us?” they teased.</p>
<p>“I’m already ‘taking a dip’ every day on Giant’s Deep, buddy,” they retorted with a calm but amused snicker. “Just let me enjoy the change of scenery, will you?”</p>
<p>“In that case, maybe you could get ground control for us?” Riebeck asked. “This is an incredible discovery! But I’m not sure my signalscope could handle the, uh. Black thing.”</p>
<p>With a shrug, Gabbro took their signalscope in one hand, the projection stone by their side in the other, and placed the latter on its edge, keeping it in place between the signalscope and the bench, before they came to lean against the backrest, arms behind their neck acting like a makeshift pillow. “Gabbro to ground control,” they announced coolly, “how’s it going?”</p>
<p>As always, the answer did not wait. <span class=radio>“Gabbro!”</span> Hornfels called in relief. <span class=radio>“We were just about to consider calling you. Shouldn’t you be close to landing on Timber Hearth by now?”</span></p>
<p>There was an awkward silence. Riebeck raised their hands to their chest and started nervously fiddling with their fingers. “O-oh. Uh. N-no, we’re still, uh. Th-that may be my f-fault,” they apologized sheepishly. “W-weren’t you listening when we said we’d stay a bit to explore the s-station because they’re Nomai ruins nobody ever went to b-before today?”</p>
<p>Hal’s voice soon answered that question by the negative: <span class=radio>“The, uh… Whoever was holding the signalscope must have put it down around that point. We thought you’d done that because you were on your way back.”</span></p>
<p>Despite the fact that neither could see them, Gabbro knew that both astronauts were now trying to give them an accusing look. With a sigh, they raised their arms up in defeat. “My bad. I got distracted.”</p>
<p>The long-distance radio went silent for a few seconds. Then, after a sigh deformed by static, Hornfels shared their cautious yet optimistic opinion: <span class=radio>“…Hm. Unexplored Nomai ruins, you say…? On the one hand, this sounds irresponsible given the circumstances. On the other— If you were the one behind the idea, Riebeck, then I’ll trust that you are all doing alright?”</span></p>
<p>“Yep,” Firn asserted, “I’m fine, everyone’s fine, everything’s fine. We’re all refueled and Riebeck’s ship is nearby and ready to launch whenever we need it. All prepped up for making major discoveries in here! They’re not related to the statues, but oh well. Good enough, I guess.”</p>
<p><span class=radio>“That’s great!”</span> Hal exclaimed with relief which soon turned to excitement: <span class=radio>“So how is that research progressing?”</span></p>
<p>“Swimmingly,” Firn smirked, a smug grin in the corner of their lips. Riebeck’s arms dropped to their sides in silence, as they looked down in their direction with four invisible and unamused eyes.</p>
<p>When their best friend replied, Firn was delighted to almost be able to <i>hear</i> their tired, deadpan look. <span class=radio>“…Why do I get the feeling this was a pun?”</span></p>
<p>“We found a working projection stone, Hal!” Riebeck decided to reply before the other astronaut could get in another word. “And a, uh. I guess it might be fitting to call this a projection <i>pool</i>,” they sighed with the tiniest annoyed grunt.</p>
<p><span class=radio>“A projection– <i>‘pool’?</i>”</span> Hornfels parroted in confusion; but after just a second, they changed their train of thought: <span class=radio>“Never mind that, you found a projection stone! Were you able to use it?”</span></p>
<p>“Yes!” Riebeck exclaimed instantly, “And, oh, <i>stars</i>,” they heaved in awe, “Hal, Hornfels, I <i>wish</i> you could see this. This is absolutely incredible!”</p>
<p class=vs>It was not long before the archeologist’s enthusiasm pushed them to entirely overtake the conversation. Firn watched for a few moments at their thrilled movements, spinning around, pointing at things and only remembering halfway through that their radio would not let them share the sights…</p>
<p>With a small silent chuckle, the cadet soon tuned out the excited and curious exchanges between the three Hearthians, trying to instead focus on what they could see themself, and swiftly turning off their radio when they felt like adding an entry or two to their ship log.</p>
<p>“From the looks of it, that other location is also orbiting Giant’s Deep,” they eventually added when it seemed like ground control was all caught up and Riebeck had nothing new to share other than long trails of giddy squeals. “It seems like it’s just another compartment from the same Nomai station.”</p>
<p>Riebeck nodded. “I saw that there was another glass chamber just like this one when I was looking for Firn and Gabbro,” they announced into their transmitter. “I suppose my first guess was wrong, it’s just that this projection stone is meant to connect the two.”</p>
<p>“And as intriguing as this is, I don’t think we’re going to find out a lot more about either room just by standing here,” Firn sighed, partially disappointed, punctuating their sentence with a fitting gesture, as they walked out of the pool.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, but still to their relief, the dark liquid instantly let go as soon as they made their first step out of the pool’s radius. Part of them was impressed by the fact that not a single drop seemed to remain stuck to their body, and that whatever this substance was made of and however it was being controlled by some kind of ancient device, the whole system appeared capable of tracking down every part of itself and not let a single one loose.</p>
<p class=vs>Firn looked around, searching on the walls with their flashlight for what could be an access to the rest of the space station: after all, surely, since it possessed multiple compartments, there had to be a means to navigate between them.</p>
<p class=vs>They were intrigued to eventually notice a circular cavity halfway to the ceiling; but after escaping the artificial gravity once more and making their way to it, they faced another disillusionment. Indeed, while the airlock which was supposed to be there was open, the path was not traversable for all that, as massive debris blocked the corridor standing after it, only leaving barely enough space to send a scout through.</p>
<p>Oh well. At least, they still had a lot to do in the chamber they were already standing in; and when they floated their way out of the broken tube and back inside, they saw that Riebeck had left the projection pool as well – if the reappearance of another torchlight’s beam was anything to go by.</p>
<p class=vs>As soon as they landed on the gravity panels and aimed their own light near the two older astronauts, Gabbro gave them a small wave of their hand from their seat on the bench, and Firn saw that Riebeck had just found a different pillar to insert their projection stone into. Just a few instants later, Riebeck indeed proceeded as such, then took a step back and gasped in awe, witnessing the flat wall before them carve itself on its own into ancient spirals full of meaning.</p>
<p>Before Riebeck could take a single step forward to attempt reading it, Firn ran to them, translator in hand:</p>
<p class=nomai>AVENS: Mallow, my better 50 percent! Cassava is sending the last of the <span class=orng>cannon</span> components. Soon (relatively speaking), we’ll know the <span class=lblue>Eye</span>’s precise location!</p>
<p>Both Hearthians exchanged a silent look, mixed with such a large number of emotions. With only one sentence, there were so many things to unpack! Riebeck was vibrating in place, physically trying to restrain themself from snatching the translator off Firn’s hands so they could read everything at once.</p>
<p>“Ooh, it really works! And it did it so fast, too!” they heaved with a massive curious grin. “And now– So they were building a cannon, and something about locating an ‘eye’…”</p>
<p>Firn squinted, seemingly focused on an entirely different part of the message. “…‘Relatively speaking’?” they read in confusion. “That’s an… odd thing to say here. You think there could be something lost in translation?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you trust your own hard work?” Riebeck asked with a raised eyebrow; but they instantly stepped closer to the wall, hesitantly bringing a finger to underline the carved scriptures, then mumbling some foreign words to themself for a few moments. Eventually, they called out into their radio: “Hal, if I say <img src=../TMP_soon-relatively-speaking.png class=isnomai>… How would you translate the <img src=../TMP_relatively-speaking.png class=isnomai> part? The translator reads it as ‘relatively speaking,’ but… That sounds a bit out of place, without context. O-or at least Firn finds that weird.”</p>
<p>“I’m not saying the translation’s inaccurate,” they corrected quickly. “All I’m saying is that maybe its meaning is clearer when it’s read in its original language. I don’t know, maybe there’s some subtlety that’s taken out when it’s translated to Hearthian or something.”</p>
<p>All the way back from Timber Hearth, the linguist took a few moments to ponder their options. Soon, their answer came out with a sigh: <span class=radio>“…No, I’m pretty sure this is as accurate as we could make it. Now that you say it though, I do wonder what they meant by that. They must be referring to something you didn’t read yet, assuming it’s written at all. What does the rest say?”</span></p>
<p>Answering with a dubious hum instead of words, Firn moved their translator to read each reply to this first message, one after the other. When Riebeck started reading each sentence out loud for ground control to hear, Gabbro felt obliged to listen in as well:</p>
<p class=nomai>AVENS: Cassava tells me he and the <span class=orng>Construction Yard</span> crew have determined a power setting we are not, under any circumstances, to go above.</p>
<p class=nomai>MALLOW: I see! And am I right to think that, consequently, we’ll be ignoring that setting?</p>
<p class=nomai>AVENS: I can posit with nearly 100 percent certainty our friends have accounted for our natures, so I suggest we do!</p>
<p class=vs>At first a little intrigued, they soon ended amused by the idea of this couple of Nomai being so excited to push their invention beyond its intended limits, and tried to imagine Slate and Feldspar in that situation.</p>
<p class=vs>For the third astronaut overall to have joined the program soon after Chert, and for one of the Hearthians who had seen for themself the duo’s progressively more grandiose contraptions and their subsequent equally grandiose explosions… Sometimes, even they still pondered how they had still agreed to be launched into space without fear.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, the appeal of calmness and loneliness, and the desire to contemplate the wonders of nature, were what they had been seeking; and in the end, the moment they had been able to leave their ship, they had found exactly that on their planet of choice.</p>
<p class=nomai>AVENS: Giving the <span class=orng>Orbital Probe Cannon</span> all the power it can structurally withstand creates the greatest chance of finding the <span class=lblue>Eye of the universe</span>.</p>
<p class=nomai>MALLOW: Yes, the probe must travel as fast as it can, as far as it can. I’ll make some adjustments!</p>
<p>“The ‘Orbital Probe Cannon’…” Riebeck repeated slowly. “Do you think this is the name of this place, then?”</p>
<p>From their seat on the nearby bench, Gabbro snorted. “It’s in orbit, and from what I remember it does look a bit like a cannon,” they shrugged. “Seems fitting.”</p>
<p><span class=radio>“And so the purpose of those ruins… They were looking for something called the ‘Eye of the Universe’? Whatever that name was supposed to refer to,”</span> Hornfels summarized, deep in thought.</p>
<p>For the past few minutes, unbeknownst to the rest of the group, Firn had remained uncharacteristically silent. It was only when they pulled their flashlight away from the wall of writings and aimed it haphazardly in multiple other directions that Riebeck noticed, briefly sending them a curious look, before ignoring them once again.</p>
<p>“Judging by what this Mallow said, it seems like that search had been going on for multiple generations,” they mused instead, going back to studying the second part of the overall exchange. “Can you believe it? They were trying to send some kind of probe, then, <i>somewhere</i>…” they pondered while reading every line for the third or fourth time. “I can only imagine what its destination must have been, or how far it must have gone by now. This cannon seems to have been fired already, but that must have been done <i>ages</i> ago.”</p>
<p>From inside their receiver, a short gasp resonated. Then, a confident assertion: “No. Not ‘ages ago.’ I’ve <i>seen</i> that thing fire.”</p>
<p>Both older astronauts turned to Firn in surprise: fists clenched, the cadet had turned to them in return, determined expression hidden only by their visor and the surrounding darkness.</p>
<p>It had taken them some time to ponder it, then to accept it; but after looking at all the evidence under their eyes… Finally, it all clicked and came together; and finally, they had managed to convince themself that this was the only remaining hypothesis they could consider relevant.</p>
<p>“This morning, the first thing I saw was a big flash of light right above me, that’s what woke me up before the sunrise,” they reasoned carefully, deep in thought. “From my perspective at the time, it was just in front of Giant’s Deep. I was wondering if it could be something in low orbit.” They raised their eyes to the other two astronauts, sparkling with curiosity and purpose: “I think— that could be it. We could be standing right inside the thing I saw blowing up, just a few sunrises ago.”</p>
<p>Even with their helmet on, disbelief could be read all over Riebeck’s spacesuit. “That’s impossible, and you must know it,” they replied simply. “The Nomai are long dead. Who could’ve possibly sent the order to fire it today?”</p>
<p>“But— I <i>know</i> I saw something,” they insisted, bringing a hand to their forehead only to meet their visor in the way. They tried their best to remember what it had looked like… “It was right in front of Giant’s Deep, and it was something small that shot a purple light. I know I saw it.”</p>
<p><span class=radio>“Couldn’t that have been some kind of thunder?”</span> Hornfels offered. <span class=radio>“Giant’s Deep’s storms often ionize its atmosphere, and those storms result in pink or purple flashes of light on a regular basis.”</span></p>
<p>“Yeah, maybe you just saw a particularly big one?” Riebeck added with a gentle tone and a light shrug. “I’m not calling you a liar, I do believe you saw something. I just think… I-it’s just impossible for the source of that flash of light to be abandoned Nomai ruins that nobody in sight could’ve possibly activated, don’t you think?”</p>
<p><span class=radio>“You say it’s what woke you up, right?”</span> Hal reasoned. <span class=radio>“Maybe, you know, you just weren’t awake enough to see it all that well.”</span></p>
<p>Firn’s sense of logic tended to agree. At least at first glance, they were all correct: even they simply could not think of a way or reason why this cannon could have just fired on its own, hundreds of thousands of years after the civilization which had built it had died out. Any Nomai construct they had seen so far could only activate if there was <i>someone</i> nearby to use them, even when the Nomai statues had activated—</p>
<p>The statues.</p>
<p class=vs>Gabbro had found these statues weeks ago. They had been able to bring one back to Timber Hearth without it ever doing anything. Even when it had been accidentally chipped and the fallen chunk had been repurposed into their ship’s information storage and secondary processor at the heart of their computer, it had never given any sign of reaction to any observation or tinkering, by anyone.</p>
<p>And then, one day, it had just… acted out on its own. Done <i>something</i> to Hal, whatever it was. Done something to Gabbro too, on the very same day, less than a sunrise later.</p>
<p>The cannon had been fired first, though. The statues had not activated the cannon — if there truly were any correlation between these two events, and there had to be one, then if anything, the <i>cannon</i> had been the reason why the statues activated, not the other way around…</p>
<p>…Which still left the lingering question of <i>what</i> had triggered the cannon, then. And unfortunately, this was where Firn ran out of ideas.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, they thus came back to the wall of writings and brought back their translator, reading every line word by word yet again, as if those could somehow bring some new hints; alas, they found none.</p>
<p>After a few instants, they teared their eyes away from their translator with a confused hum, and raised them up to the other side of the windows, frowning. Looking at the black shadow of Giant’s Deep, they asked the other two astronauts: “…Did everything just get darker all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>Riebeck shrugged, assuming that what the cadet meant was that they also thought that distinguishing the carved words’ details seemed to have become somewhat harder, for some reason. And so, they simply opted to point their flashlight in the same direction as theirs and bend forward a little bit, in order to bring more light to the writings on the wall. “This structure is orbiting Giant’s Deep,” they reasoned, “we must have reached its dark side. I sure can’t see the sun from here.”</p>
<p>Gabbro frowned in turn, mumbling mostly to themself: “But we already <i>were</i> in the shadow of Giant’s Deep.”</p>
<p>That, and even when they were on the dark side, its atmosphere still reflected at least <i>some</i> of the sun’s light, coloring the planet’s shadow in dark green instead of pure black. Now that Firn was saying it… It was true that the dark side currently looked much darker than usual. Unnaturally so.</p>
<p class=vs>From pitch black, the echoes of the sun then turned bright blue. Alas, none of the three astronauts were in a position to notice, fault of the gas giant blocking the view; and back on Timber Hearth, the rotation of the planet on its own axis had decided that, in this moment, sunset had passed and sunrise had yet to come.</p>
<p>And so, all Hearthians from ground control and in orbit remained unaware up to the very moment when the end would claim them, each in turn.</p>
<hr>
<p>Suspicion rose once more when all three travelers’ radios picked up a fleeting, but loud screeching sound – only followed by ominous silence.</p>
<p>Riebeck was the first to find their words again. “W-w-what was that?”</p>
<p>“Did someone’s radio malfunction?” Firn called out, looking at one of their companions, then the other.</p>
<p>“I can hear you two just fine,” Gabbro stated instantly.</p>
<p>Six pairs of eyes turned to the signalscope. It looked in normal shape.</p>
<p>“Hal?” Firn called out tentatively, trying not to sound anxious.</p>
<p>“H-Hornfels?” Riebeck followed, absolutely not hiding the fact that they were starting to worry.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“Must be a problem on their end,” Gabbro deduced with a heavy shrug. “Who knows, maybe Mica’s model ship crashed into the comms. Heh.”</p>
<p class=vs>And as they were saying these last words, they picked up their signalscope with another shrug; but in the process, the eons old Nomai artifact they had been using to keep it in place could no longer stand upright: and therefore, it lost its balance and unceremoniously fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Because of the sight rather than the absence of sound, Firn turned their head curiously, then squinted as they bent down to retrieve it…</p>
<p>“Wait– Is that <i>another</i> projection stone?” Riebeck exclaimed, wide-eyed.</p>
<p>Gabbro raised an eyebrow, then looked to their side. “…Oh yeah, right,” they suddenly remembered, “I’d found it on the bench. I was meaning to show it to you, but then I forgot. Totally my bad.”</p>
<p>Riebeck rolled their upper eyes, but kept their silence. Instead, they simply bent down and pointed their flashlight at the stone’s definitely-glowing-and-yet-not-at-all-glowing-apparently side — something which, again, put Gabbro on edge.</p>
<p>“This one has three branched hexagons,” Firn stated. “Does that mean there’s a third chamber on this station?”</p>
<p>Riebeck hummed thoughtfully. “I only remember seeing two, though.”</p>
<p>“Given how broken the whole place is, maybe it’s just gone,” Gabbro shrugged.</p>
<p>Riebeck deflated. “You think so…? That would be a real shame.”</p>
<p>Firn gave a nod of their helmet in the direction of the projection pool: “Well, quite convenient that we have a way to find out right here. I’ll be right back.”</p>
<p class=vs>As the archeologist cheered in anticipation, Firn trotted their way to the pillars at the center of the chamber, then instantly inserted the projection stone: indeed, what they saw at first looked extremely similar to the two rooms they had already found from the station, with the notable difference that the landscape outside of it did not look at all like Giant’s Deep. At least its interior still looked intact.</p>
<p>They looked around for a few seconds, until their eyes fell upon a sight which sent a shiver down their spine:</p>
<p>Less than a dozen meters away from their perspective, the three stone eyes of a Nomai statue were staring back.</p>
<p>Firn opened their mouth wide, ready to share the news with a shocked gasp — but before they could utter a single word, the three second-to-last Hearthians in existence were burned alive in an instant.</p>

<!-- @SFOLD — 002 — CHAPTER 1²: Good Morning ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— -->
<div class=chp id=ch1_2><h1>Chapter 1²</h1><h2>Good Morning</h2><hr>
<p>“And don’t forget the <i>blinds</i>, next time!” Hal warned with a hand curled up around their mouth to let the sound of their voice reach its target.</p>
<p>Somewhere else in the universe, courtesy of the Ash Twin Project’s core objective and most impressive feat, a white hole opened, flaring up with streams of information.</p>
<p>As they watched Marl stomp their way down the mountain road and back to the village below, Hal’s ears caught the sound of laughter coming from behind.</p>
<p>Out of any Hearthian’s sight, yet from not too far away, a Nomai statue, marvel of eons old technology, remembered three very important things.</p>
<p>“They’ll never change, will they?”</p>
<p>First, its orientation was wrong. Clockwise, it was exactly two hundred and forty-one degrees off.</p>
<p>Hal looked up the path they had intended to take up to the observatory, and found that Gossan was currently walking down from it, having likely witnessed the scene from afar on their way.</p>
<p>Second, its eyes were not supposed to be closed.</p>
<p>The flight coach sent them a friendly wave right after their quip, and with a small tired smile, Hal waved back.</p>
<p>And, third: it, alongside its associated mask, had a fundamentally crucial job to do.</p>
<p>“Never mind them,” the hatchling sighed. “You know they’ll be right back at it before the next…”</p>
<p>Their sentence trailed off. Going from an amused chuckle to a surprised, then concerned frown, Gossan stared as Hal’s eyes slowly turned empty and unfocused.</p>
<p>The founder first attempted humor, as a corner of their mouth was nervously and unconvincingly tilted upwards: “Uh. Yes, Hal? The next…?”</p>
<p>This valiant attempt soon proved pointless. Hal remained entirely still, unwavering.</p>
<p class=vs>Getting more and more worried, they put a hand on the hatchling’s shoulder, gave it a squeeze, then shook with more vehemence as they yelled their name multiple times, louder and louder.</p>
<p>No response.</p>
<p class=vs>At a loss for what to do, Gossan turned to the village below and called for help, their voice echoing over the cliff and into the crater.</p>
<p>At least they were still breathing, they sighed to themself; but the fact that they could only observe it for certain after they had removed one of their gloves, through feeling on the back of their hand the light and slow, barely noticeable air current going in and out of their nostrils, instead of through any visual or audible cues, did not reassure them in the slightest.</p>
<p>Marl had heard the cries from their current position a few meters below, and a dozen of seconds later, they were running to them, asking what was wrong — although they were soon able to see the problem for themself.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, they just… froze? Just like that?”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand,” the elder stated as they slipped their glove back on, struggling to remain calm, “you know as well as I do that they were fine a minute ago. Unless you saw something strange when you were talking to them?”</p>
<p>“Nope,” they shook their head. “Grumpy, but completely normal.” Crossing their arms, they added: “If you ask me, that’s another of Firn’s stupid jokes.”</p>
<p>Gossan frowned. “Hal’s never been roped into their pranks <i>willingly</i>. And even if they were faking this somehow, they would’ve cracked by now.”</p>
<p class=vs>Marl rolled their upper eyes, mumbling smugly that <i>oh, they knew how to make them crack</i> and that there was no way they could possibly keep it up for long.</p>
<p class=vs>Pursing their lips, they cautiously came closer, slightly bent down to reach Hal at eye level, squinted as they tried to meet their gaze – and gave a light flick against their forehead.</p>
<p>Not even a blink.</p>
<p>Their mouth dropped, blood draining off their face in an instant. “<i>Spawner of all anglerfish</i> they’re good.”</p>
<p>Gossan gave a low and nervous grunt, fists trembling. “Marl, it was already obvious that they’re not responding to any stimuli.”</p>
<p>“Yeah yeah, let me just try real quick–” they mumbled to give themself some courage, preferring to hold on to their last threads of denial over accepting defeat and openly falling into panic as a consequence. “Trust me, there’s no way they’ll ignore that one.” They slowly came a little closer to Hal’s ear, took a sharp breath…</p>
<p>“Marl!” Gossan hissed, rushing ahead and grabbing their arm before pulling away with force, then shooing them with stern worry.</p>
<p>“What?” they shrugged tensely, “Firn does it all the time.”</p>
<p>“Stop fooling around and go get Porphy,” the founder growled. “Whatever this is, it’s serious!”</p>
<p>As the younger Hearthian stepped backwards with a frown and a reluctant nod, then turned around to start leaving, Gossan came closer to Hal’s face themself, studying it from up close and cupping their chin as an attempt to take a better look at their glassy eyes.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to them, a few more moments of waiting were necessary – for even though the Orbital Probe Cannon had long finished calculating its newest randomly defined trajectory, the process of physically reorienting its entire structure could not be accomplished in the span of mere seconds.</p>
<p class=vs>But then, finally, the requisite position was met: and so, with the confirmation that the Ash Twin Project had successfully synchronized all databases and that this exact moment was the perfect window for the probe to be fired along the path it had settled on for this loop, all active statues’ most important duty was completed with two last orders, executed in quick succession.</p>
<p class=vs>Firstly: <i>create a savestate</i>, for the main purpose of making subsequent data transfers more efficient, but also for the secondary purpose of having a safe point to return to, in the event of possible corruption or other unlikely incidents which could always occur during the following loop.</p>
<p>And secondly, now that all preparation steps had been executed without a hitch, and now that the time to fire the probe had been met: <i>switch back to data collection</i>.</p>
<p>High up near the zenith, a flash of light briefly illuminated Giant’s Deep; and at the exact same time, with a burst of sudden awareness, Hal gasped awake.</p>
<hr>
<p>A part of Hal forgotten by all, even by themself, had wished to never see the metaphorical records room ever again.</p>
<p>This part of Hal once had, in a future that longer was, naively thought that, strange as their initial experience had been, it only was a single occurrence which would not be repeated.</p>
<p>But as immutable past and uncollapsed future merged to become one, Hal was forcefully confronted to their previous fear of permanence, in one rather ironic way — for the Ash Twin Project was about many things, yes, but if there was one thing it was hardly intended to be delving into, it was set in stone certainty.</p>
<p>From somewhere in the back of their mind, an uncomfortably familiar, yet definitely foreign observer, opened its three mechanical eyes once more and established a link with its securely protected database: but this time, it had not come to absorb more of the information it had been greedily hoarding. Instead, it forced open some metaphorical doors, filled all at once a few rows of a metaphorical records room’s metaphorical shelves, reached out for a metaphorical tape deck in the midst of it all — and, all at once, it returned everything it had amassed.</p>
<p class=vs>At first, Hal was far from having a single clue as to what was happening. In fact, in the very first few instants, far was it from them to even be capable of realizing that the conversation they were having with Gossan was naught but a figment of their imagination being forcefully replayed inside their mind: for the memory was far too vivid for the Hearthian to be capable of identifying it as a dream, and for the Ash Twin Project had chosen a different approach to its previous intervention. After all, the algorithm for first pairing with a statue was distinct from the one meant to synchronize data at the beginning of a loop: and contrary to the former, the latter was asked to help the paired person tune out everything which was either irrelevant or bound to hinder the progress of the current, crucial task of reminiscing.</p>
<p>Hal had indeed felt <i>something</i> reach out, briefly, before it started; but by the time their senses had been cut off and the metaphorical tape deck had started playing as a temporary replacement, this sensation had become all but an afterthought — not unlike the inconvenience of having been bit by a mosquito in the back of their head while they weren’t looking, but of being unable to do anything about it now that the void-forsaken thing had already taken off and vanished into the night.</p>
<p>By the time the memory of meeting and getting stared at by the museum’s statue came, Hal felt an additional layer of intrigue: somehow, this reminisced sensation was <i>supposed</i> to be new, and yet it felt familiar, as if they had experienced it a few dozen minutes ago – a few dozen minutes which were, in reality, two seconds and nine hundredths.</p>
<p>And then, as the metaphorical tape reel met its end with a sudden and burning finale, the Ash Twin Project returned the last thing it had taken: in an instant, Hal regained their senses – in the most literal meaning possible.</p>
<p>The image of Hornfels’ ground control panel disappeared with an eerily bright and burning flash of light; and as their true vision cleared, Hal startled to the sight of Gossan’s face, too little too close to their own for comfort, and to the touch of a glove holding their chin. As soon as this realization set in, the unexplained and unexplainable breach of their personal space caused them to jump backwards with a high-pitched yelp.</p>
<p>Gossan’s hand remained still and stuck in midair for a second or two, cupping something that no longer was there, as they stared back in shock; but soon, they brought their arm down to their side and sighed.</p>
<p>“<i>Finally</i>,” Hal heard the founder exhale, eyes briefly rising to the stars. The three eyes lowered instantly to meet theirs again, and the next words they heard were clearly destined to them: “Oi, hatchling. You good?”</p>
<p>Hal tried and failed to stop themself from taking a few more steps backwards and away from them, uncomfortably rubbing their chin in confusion.</p>
<p>“Wha… What happened?” they wondered aloud, unsure whether they were consciously asking, or merely voicing their befuddlement to the void of the universe.</p>
<p>There was the sound of quick footsteps approaching, then Hal jumped again at the touch of a hand clasping against their shoulder from behind.</p>
<p>“Welcome back to the living,” they heard Marl huff in their back, their dark humor failing to conceal the immense relief in their voice.</p>
<p>Hal frowned hesitantly, mindlessly yet politely removing the uninvited hand of their cabinmate from their personal space. “Living…? What? D-did I just… <i>die</i>, or…?”</p>
<p>Gossan stopped staring for a second or two, just long enough for them to instead send the lumberjack a dark glare and wordlessly berate them for their indelicate and distressing statement, which <i>evidently</i> had no business whatsoever being uttered in such situation. “Of course not, since you’re still with us,” they clarified as soon as they could regain their soft tone. “But you sure gave us a good fright there.”</p>
<p class=vs>None of this made any sense. Hal still felt disoriented and in some form of daze, and yet all at the same time, everything felt so <i>lucid</i>– not just the present, but also what they were so certain had only occurred mere seconds ago. Hornfels, the observatory, the long-distance radio connection with Firn and Riebeck and Gabbro — where had it all gone?</p>
<p class=vs>Courtesy of that blasted metaphorical records room, it felt as if a specific tape was jammed inside the recorder, stuck repeating on loop an instant so short that it could almost be mistaken for a still image, but unfortunately just long enough to maintain its overwhelming vividness in all five senses; and now, they just could not quite shake away that feeling of intense, seething and <i>burning</i> heat which was replaying in the back of their puzzled mind, right between their last moments at the observatory and their first moment of Gossan’s face obscuring ninety percent of their field of vision.</p>
<p>They were internally pleading for peace and an end to this pain, yet all at the same time, desperately scrambling for answers which only their most recent memories of the events marking the transition between those two sceneries could provide: had Phlox been warned and given the chance to give a tip or two regarding how to debug such dilemmatic situation, he most likely would have sighed and explained that, of course, it was no wonder that the memory processing software would be confused if it were given such mixed signals in the form of two fundamentally opposite requests, and that since this alien youth had chosen to use a library of magnetic tapes as an analogy, then… Well, surely they could understand that trying to press the ‘Stop’ and ‘Play’ buttons simultaneously was, quite frankly, rather idiotic.</p>
<p>After about a dozen seconds, Hal mercifully found out how to remove their metaphorical finger from the metaphorical ‘Play’ button, mostly thanks to their desire to both get rid of the phantom pain and focus on what Gossan had just told them in the present, rather than on whatever had happened prior to… ending up here. Wherever ‘here’ was.</p>
<p class=vs>They looked around. It was nighttime. They could hear crickets. All three of them were standing near the patch of ghost matter, and even closer to the entrance of the zero-g cave.</p>
<p>No, really, what were they doing outside of the observatory? They had no memory whatsoever of walking out, and they least of all could think of any reason why they would have done so at such a crucial moment, when Firn and Riebeck were so kind to let them discuss their findings in real time.</p>
<p>After a few more seconds of looking around in stunned silence, Hal found themself with less answers and even more questions than they started with; and so, lips and all four eyebrows trembling, they asked again: “…What <i>happened?</i>”</p>
<p>“<i>You</i> tell us,” Marl scoffed in disbelief. “You’re walking off like normal, Gossan says you started talking to them, and then just like that, you’re…”</p>
<p class=vs>Their sentence trailing off, Marl’s hands were raised as they seemed to search for the proper words. In the end, they gave up with a noncommittal shrug and remained silent for a few short moments, their head slowly shaking from right to left and their hands only conveying their support to their face’s full display of confusion and disbelief, punctuating their performance with a <i>“You know?”</i></p>
<p>Hal squinted and shook their head slowly, having understood absolutely none of it.</p>
<p>Marl crossed their arms and pouted. “Yeah, well, I was already on my way to fetch some help. One more second of whatever that was, and I was too far away to hear you scream.”</p>
<p>Hal gave a tentative but still disoriented hum, staring at a firefly flying by as some kind of attempt to, paradoxically, remain focused and grounded in reality.</p>
<p>The comforting presence of Gossan was brought back to their attention when they slowly came into their field of vision, mindfully ensuring to give them space this time, now that they trusted the young Hearthian to not collapse on the floor or crumble to dust any moment.</p>
<p>“You have been completely unresponsive for at least a whole minute, perhaps even two,” they stated, putting as little worry into their voice as they could, but forgetting to conceal the distress radiating from their three good eyes. “Nothing we did could snap you out of it.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t even pass out or anything, you really just <i>stood there</i>, upright, staring at nothing.” Evidently, by this point Marl had completely given up on trying to lie about the fact that the event had left them utterly freaked out.</p>
<p>Hal lowered their eyes to the ground, frowning as they tried to take in this new information. When they realized that they had no idea what to make of it, they slowly mumbled with a noncommittal shrug: “Well, I’m… fine now. I guess?”</p>
<p>“Sure you’re not gonna pass out or anything?” their cabinmate insisted with concern. “You need some water?”</p>
<p class=vs>They simply shook their head. If anything, in this moment, they somehow felt fresher than they had ever been: the vividness of their memories had felt unreal – in the sense that they appeared far too aware, just as tangible as their current perception of reality was.</p>
<p>This was confusing to be sure, confusing enough to make it hard to focus all their thoughts on being distressed or horrified by it. But confused as they were, and incapable as they were of identifying just <i>what</i> was happening, or perhaps even what was what in general… This was not by any means a confusion born out of physical or mental weakness.</p>
<p>Or at least… They didn’t think so? They slowly let their eyes squint into a trembling uncertain frown as they looked around once more, incapable of reconciling their observations with what they thought they knew.</p>
<p>“I… I don’t know why I’m here, but I should go back to the observatory,” they eventually mumbled. “Firn and Riebeck were exploring those ruins orbiting Giant’s Deep, and—”</p>
<p>Gossan stared in disbelief. “Giant’s Deep? What are you talking about? Firn hasn’t even launched yet.”</p>
<p>Right after a shiver running down their spine in one swift vertical movement, the hatchling returned their stare right back at them, wearing the same expression. “…<i>What?</i>”</p>
<p>The flight coach looked past the cliff, then pointed at a wooden structure in the distance – and more specifically, at a white contraption standing on top of it. “Their ship’s still there,” they stated flatly. Then, turning back to stare with even more concern than before: “Are you <i>sure</i> you’re doing alright?”</p>
<p>Eyes widening alongside their gaping mouth, Hal stumbled forward, soon stopped in their tracks when one of the founder’s gloves was pressed against their chest and prevented them from stepping too close to the cliff. “B– <span class=scaps>b</span>-but how? There’s no way they could’ve come back so fast… A-and what about Riebeck?”</p>
<p>Marl deadpanned. “Yeah, I’m fetching Rutile, sounds more like their thing than Porphy’s,” they announced – sending in the process a quick knowing glance at Gossan, and expecting that their preference for the local cook and improvised apothecary was based on at least some level of bias related to personal feelings, more than actual relevance to the situation. “Maybe a meteorite conked their head and it was just too small for us to see it. I’ll be right back with a real doctor.”</p>
<p>“T-to the observatory,” Hal blabbered quickly. The other two Hearthians gave them a confused look, and they soon added with an unsure voice: “P-please. You can get them if you want, maybe I <i>do</i> somehow need some kind of medical attention, but— There’s something I <i>have</i> to check there.”</p>
<p>Marl looked at Gossan expectantly, waiting for their input. Gossan looked at Hal’s pleading eyes, and their melting heart soon caved in. “…Fine. Marl, bring them to the museum. I’ll make sure Hal makes it there in one piece.”</p>
<p>Hal released a breath they did not realize they were holding. “Thank you,” they heaved in relief.</p>
<hr>
<p>The walk to the observatory, while usually short and uneventful for any taking the route, was this time tense and awkward. There were questions to be asked from both sides, concerns to be shared, ponderings about the nature of the universe on the one hand, and about the possible presence of a concussion in a certain hatchling on the other. Short glances were exchanged and then quickly ignored, as neither found the courage to proceed with an actual conversation – for the ice encasing them was at first thicker than that of the Interloper.</p>
<p>Thankfully, after a while, the silence became too heavy for Hal to bear; and the Interloper somehow found its way close enough to the sun for its casing to melt, if ever so slightly.</p>
<p>“Gossan…” They gulped. They needed answers, but there simply was no way to voice this question in a manner which would not raise even <i>more</i> concerns. “What was I doing before I, uh— before it happened? When did it start?”</p>
<p>“You’d just told Marl to leave that tree alone,” they soon answered. Then, after a short pause: “<i>Please</i> tell me you remember that.”</p>
<p>“Oh– o-oh yeah, yeah, I remember that,” they nodded eagerly. They decided not to mention that, from their own perspective, they remembered this having happened at least a couple sunrises earlier, rather than the few minutes it had presumably been since they somehow woke up back there. “And after that you came down the path from the observatory and we started talking.”</p>
<p>A single, decisive nod. “And then you froze mid-sentence.”</p>
<p>Hal bit their lip. “I thought we had a full conversation… before I woke up and realized it had all been in my imagination somehow, that is.” The whole conversation<i> and</i> the couple sunrises, apparently.</p>
<p>Gossan gave a small, nervous smile. “So you just kept talking inside your head and forgot to say any of it out loud?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and I guess I even hallucinated your answers too,” Hal chuckled tiredly, “with all that stuff about Firn’s launch day and your idea to make me feel better by giving them some last minute training with some mining equipment that broke, or something.”</p>
<p class=vs>Gossan’s eyes widened at once. Courtesy of their lowered guard and missing eye combined, they slipped on a misplaced and treacherously unstable rock, and almost lost their balance. Hal turned to them in alert, ready to help but coming after they had already regained their footing on their own.</p>
<p>The coach raised a hand to gesture that they were fine physically speaking; but their look of sheer confusion and shock indicated that this was, indeed, only physically speaking.</p>
<p>They strangled a weird noise. “I– beg your pardon?”</p>
<p>Hal’s ears dropped nervously. “Uh– Heh, yeah, I know, that would’ve been a funny coincidence, if something had <i>really</i> broke on their launch day, haha, I guess that was just some kind of weird wishful thinking– I-<span class=scaps>i</span> mean not <i>wishful</i> thinking, it’s not like I’d actually <i>wish</i> for something to <i>break</i>, but— Uh, a-and hey, later when I thought I’d met with Hornfels and they said they’d sent you to fetch me, that just doesn’t make any sense, right? Since in the conversation I dreamed about, you didn’t get to bring that up at all—”</p>
<p>Gossan looked like their missing eye wanted to magically grow back just so it could be given the chance to open wide enough to pop right out of its orbit all over again. “Hal—”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know, I sound completely insane,” they sighed dejectedly. “Honestly, I think my plan is just to take a quick look at the museum, let Rutile inspect me, and go straight back to bed with maybe some– whatever herbs Porphy can find for that. You think it could’ve been the sap wine from yesterday evening? Maybe we were all wrong, and I can’t stomach it properly just yet.”</p>
<p><i>Sap wine won’t make you read minds</i>, came a strained whisper too quiet to escape past Gossan’s gritting teeth. With their fists clenched tightly enough that they were visibly shaking, they pressed their lips shut and took a deep inhale through their nose. “…So what do you expect to see at the museum?”</p>
<p>“I’m gonna find the statue. In that whole hallucination, or whatever that was, it felt like it’d done <i>something</i> to my head, so uh– Y-yeah. Don’t worry, it’s just for me. As soon as we get there, I’ll see that it’s all normal, just like Hornfels wanted to prep it, that it <i>didn’t</i> move on its own to stare into my brain, and that’ll be the end of it as soon as I see its closed eyes and it proves me wrong.”</p>
<hr>
<p>The statue did not prove them wrong.</p>
<p>Jaw falling to the ground as soon as its shape became clear enough to show its golden, <i>open</i> eyes, Hal made Gossan cry out a quiet surprised yelp when they suddenly gasped and sprinted forward, leaving them behind. The founder initially wanted to gently but sternly scold them for the sudden change of pace; but the next moment, their three good eyes met in turn with the ancient sculpture, and they had a double take of their own.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t like that the last time I was here,” they heaved with incomprehension the moment they stepped inside the wooden room. “And I was here less than ten minutes ago.”</p>
<p>“I-it’s just like— it’s <i>turned</i>, too, just like how it did when it looked at me,” Hal blabbered in panic. They seemed about to say more, but their head had turned to the side for a brief moment; and when their eyes met those of the other Hearthian next to them, their mouth slammed shut. Instead of sharing any further thought, they cowered and fiddled with their hands, avoiding their gaze. “G-<span class=scaps>g</span>ossan, I…”</p>
<p>“Hal, you can stop pretending that you’re the problem,” they called out in a low tone, shaking their head nervously. “It’s not sap wine, and I hope we both agree that you’re not crazy. It’s the third time you’ve talked about something you shouldn’t be able to know— <i>Something</i> is going on, and that something isn’t you being unwell. I’ve seen enough evidence to at least take you seriously, and because of that, I need you to tell me what <i>really</i> happened.”</p>
<p class=vs>Admittedly, it would have been a lie to say that they were fully, blindly trusting their words, or even that they would be naive enough to take them at face value. As much as they had told Marl that the likelihood of this situation being yet another elaborate prank from Firn was infinitesimal considering the fact that Hal had never before been a willing accomplice, and that they most likely would never be… Hal had many times been an <i>involuntary</i> accomplice.</p>
<p>Gossan could not begin to fathom how any kind of scheme capable of explaining Hal’s behavior and incongruous knowledge could have been set up, let alone without having Hal themself figure out that they were somehow tricked into seeing things; but if only because the alternative somehow sounded even <i>more</i> dubious than this already far-fetched idea… They still thought that, far-fetched and evidence-lacking as it currently was, it was a little too early to rule out this option just yet.</p>
<p class=vs>Firn’s pranks were either imperceptible or confusing until it was too late to stop them, and given the fact that they tended to happen weekly or even biweekly on average, they also became paranoia-inducing rather quickly. And yet… In this current situation, it sounded almost like a comforting thought, while compared to the idea of being confronted to the utter inexplicable.</p>
<p>Firn’s pranks were charted territory – the familiar kind of unpredictable chaos. This, on the other hand… If Firn had nothing to do with it, then the sheer impossibility that remained felt darker and deadlier than even Brittle Hollow’s black hole.</p>
<p>All the while… Regardless of Gossan’s words and invitation to share their experience, Hal had remained silent, shy and anxious, guiltily staring at the ground.</p>
<p>And so, eventually, the founder closed their eyes with a sigh. “…Alright then. Stop me if I’m wrong,” they muttered, breaking the silence themself. “When it looked like from outside that you were frozen in place and unresponsive, what happened for you instead was that… Life just seemed to carry on as normal for a while?” Hal sent them a brief look, soon looking away and pursing their lips. They gave a tiny nod, and Gossan immediately added: “And you didn’t even realize that something was off up until you came to?”</p>
<p>Another nod. “It felt like I had just… I don’t even know. It just felt so <i>real</i>, like I really was there! And then it just… stopped? One second I was in the observatory with Hornfels, then there was a burning flash of light, and then I was outside with you and Marl. And then you both tell me that the past few sunrises never existed.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by ‘the past few sunrises’? Just how long did it last from<i> your</i> perspective?”</p>
<p>Gossan realized too little too late that their tone must have been more severe and urging than it should have, because Hal’s anxiety spiked once more, as their eyes darted away and their hands came to clutch their chest as a desperate attempt not to fall into panic.</p>
<p>“I c-can’t tell for sure, nobody was really looking at the time,” they stuttered. “Firn and Riebeck and Gabbro were making huge discoveries about the Nomai, we were way too excited to think of anything else! But… It definitely felt like it’d been long enough for most of the morning to have passed. Maybe it was even just around time for lunch? I thought I was starting to feel hungry… b-but I’m not anymore? I don’t… I just don’t understand.”</p>
<p>Lunch time was about three sunrises from now. All things considered, this was quite a long time for someone who had only been frozen in place for a minute or two.</p>
<p>Gossan pinched their lips together, squinting in order to try hiding their disbelief. It was time to finally stop beating around the bush and call the situation for what it was: “So… you saw the <i>future</i>, then?”</p>
<p>Hal pouted, mouth and eyebrows crumpling into indecision. “Some future that d-didn’t happen, I guess?”</p>
<p>“But a future I could imagine happen if you <i>hadn’t</i> been frozen to see it in the first place,” Gossan mumbled dubiously, unsure themself whether they should trust their own words or listen to their instinct to discredit them as pure and simple insanity. “I think we’re past questioning whether that vision you had was <i>accurate</i> – and at the stage of questioning <i>how</i> it could’ve shown you things you couldn’t possibly have known.”</p>
<p>As well as, perhaps, at the stage of actually experimenting further and testing whether Hal would be able to predict even more events or details they should not be able to know normally. Three sunrises was quite a lot of time, given the circumstances; and even though Gossan had heard enough to have their curiosity piqued and their disbelief heavily challenged… Well, this tale simply was too outlandish, and as such, they certainly would appreciate seeing more evidence to further prove their version of the events.</p>
<p>Though, of course… For this to happen, they first needed the hatchling’s cooperation. Unfortunately, in the current moment, their anxiety made this far more difficult than it needed to be; but they still had to commend them for their attempt at remaining calm… and could only fathom just how distressing their experience must have been for them to be left in such a state.</p>
<p>Hal was trying to take deep breath after deep breath, keeping their eyes closed in silence; and Gossan soon recognized it as the breathing technique Gabbro had taught them so long ago.</p>
<p class=vs>Precisely because they were such a worrywart, this technique was one of the first things Gabbro had shared with them, perhaps as far back as the very first time the two had met, when Hal had to be barely taller than Tephra. As much as the saying <i>‘Gabbro is Gabbro’</i> went in the village… If they often invited Hal to follow them to some kind of secret spot in the woods every once in a while, and if Hal came back afterwards feeling far more at peace than they had upon leaving, then this certainly had to account for something.</p>
<p>Gossan had found Gabbro to be somewhat difficult at times during their training, notably due to their tendency to be easily distracted and dismiss conversations as a result, and more generally speaking, due to their tendency to forget about teamwork. However, they would always admit that somehow, sometimes, there were some things that only they could do right: and finding a magical way to teach Hal how to better manage their anxious nature definitely was one of them.</p>
<p>All this to say that, lonesome and carefree as the Hearthian themself was… The years following their first launch had left a mark somewhere else. It was not quite obvious enough to be visible – but impossible to miss for those who knew where to look.</p>
<p class=vs>As skeptical as they wished they could be about this entire situation, from Hal’s concerning symptoms to their impossible knowledge, Gossan could not change a very simple fact: Hal, the sweet, honest hatchling who had never once told a lie in their life, could be wrong about all this – and Gossan <i>wanted</i> them to be wrong, wished for them to have somehow been tricked into seeing things. However… they were not lying.</p>
<p>They were not lying, and for all that Gossan knew, if they were not wrong either, then this entire situation was quite simply breaking all known laws of physics.</p>
<p>Gossan grew too tense and guilty to maintain the silence. They brought a hand to the hatchling’s shoulder as an attempt to ground and comfort them, only to wince when they cowered further instead, losing the count in their breathing and briefly opening their eyes to stare back in fear and shame.</p>
<p>Hal’s eyes were forcefully closed again, as they tried to steady their breathing once again. “I don’t know what’s going on,” they heaved tensely. “None of this makes any sense, but I <i>know</i> what I saw— It’s just, I wouldn’t ever believe it if it’d happened to anyone else, I’d be thinking that this <i>has</i> to be staged somehow— all this is just so…”</p>
<p>“Hal, listen,” Gossan muttered tiredly. “Maybe the statue having moved on its own <i>could</i> have been staged. But what you told me before that? Geysers, I hadn’t even made up my <i>mind</i> yet about giving Firn some last minute training. I didn’t mention the idea to Tektite, or to Hornfels, or to anyone– <i>nobody</i> could have told you about it but me. And I didn’t tell you anything.”</p>
<p>With their hand on their shoulder, Gossan slowly rubbed their thumb in small circles. They were no Gabbro, but they hoped this would be enough.</p>
<p>“I’ll believe that much: somehow, you <i>saw</i> something impossible,” they continued. “Either you saw the future or you read my mind, it’s one or the other. I have no clue what happened either, or how it did, but I’m here to help you figure it out. Alright?”</p>
<p class=vs>There was a loud breath, as Hal raised their head and filled in their lungs as much as they could. A few more moments of stillness and silence followed; but when their eyes opened again, to Gossan’s relief, they seemed a lot more peaceful. The two exchanged a glance, and Hal’s eyes seemed to finally reflect the acknowledgement that, regardless of the circumstances, Gossan <i>trusted them</i>; that in this moment, they would doubt the integrity of the entire universe before they would believe Hal to willingly tell a lie.</p>
<p>Part of them felt guilty over the fact that, technically, Gossan had been trying to make that clear for a while already; but this entire situation was just so unbelievable and incomprehensible… More than being believed, hearing the words that <i>they were not alone</i> were what truly, finally brought them some solace.</p>
<p>Hal took a deep breath, mouth open with a small, shy but worried smile showing in the corners of their lips; but before they could exhale with words, hurried footsteps stomped their way into the room — and both Hearthians turned around in alert to find two others coming straight for them.</p>
<p>“Marl gave me mixed messages,” Rutile stated urgently with a serious frown the moment they thought they were within both earshot and conventionally acceptable distance for a civilized conversation. “Was it a <i>syncope</i> or a <i>seizure</i>? And for the love of the Hearth, <i>please</i> don’t call it a stroke.”</p>
<p>Without any other word, just as less than a dozen seconds ago they had yet to even be inside the room proper, the mayor rapidly stomped their way to Hal and plastered a hand against their forehead, staring at it in silence for a moment. The hatchling blinked several times, mouth hanging open in surprise, but they made an effort to remain motionless.</p>
<p>With a few more seconds passed, Rutile let out an annoyed huff through their nose. “No fever,” they grumbled, instantly turning around towards the exit and regaining their previous pace. “Honestly, Marl, I don’t know what you were on about. You know it isn’t a first for Hal to get various ‘symptoms’ because of their anxious nature alone. With Firn’s launch day, it’s no wonder it would get worse than usual.”</p>
<p>Marl caught up with them in large strides, stopping in front of the open door and waving their arms in panic. “No no no, you don’t get it,” they pleaded, “this time it was something <i>really</i> weird!” With a fast blink, the young adult diverted their eyes away from the elder and pleaded to another: “Gossan, you can vouch for me! A little help? Please? You saw it just like me! They just stayed frozen for a whole minute, like a statue!”</p>
<p class=vs>Gossan’s mouth twisted into a conflicted frown, as they sent Hal a quick, apologetic glance. It <i>had</i> been their initial request to fetch medical help after all, even though they were now unsure just how useful it was supposed to be. Panic aside, Hal indeed appeared to be in perfect shape physically speaking, and spending time examining them would be time spent both distressing them and not solving the actual problem… But still, what could be made of their previous state? Could there be undetectable, lingering consequences?</p>
<p>Regardless of what their eventual decision would have been, they would not have been given time to act upon it, as Rutile was faster than all:</p>
<p>“Syncope it is, then,” they sighed while rubbing their upper eyes. “Look, the fact is that whatever happened, I don’t see anything unusual here. So if you don’t mind, I have a first launch to watch and buckets of water to prepare, and then Tektite said they would give me some news about that smoke they saw in Youngbark Crater — speaking of, Marl, be on your guard because your help might be needed there.”</p>
<p>The lumberjack’s ears deflated. “But…”</p>
<p>“Look, Porphy can give you something if they think it’ll help, but really— I’d wager they just worried themself to death all night and didn’t have enough sleep,” the elder grumbled with a wide eye roll. “What else do you want me to say? Eat more sugar, don’t climb up harsh slopes when you’re feeling tired, and Hal,” they concluded as they turned to point a stern finger at the hatchling in question all the while stepping backwards and out of the museum, “<i>stop</i> being so void-numbingly scared of everything.”</p>
<p>Had the museum been built with a working door, Rutile would most likely have punctuated their harangue with a peremptory slam, asserting both the authority of their final say and the unsaid <i>“Stop wasting my time, you all know that I have a whole village to maintain in a non-burning state.”</i></p>
<p>A few seconds of dismayed silence passed; then Marl, who had been closest to the door all the while to watch them half stomp, half run their way out, turned a betrayed and angry face towards the two remaining Hearthians.</p>
<p>“<i>Seriously?</i> You didn’t even try to say<i> anything!?</i>”</p>
<p>Gossan gritted their teeth awkwardly. “I’m sorry for all this, Marl. You did well, you couldn’t have known. It’s just that… the situation has evolved a little bit since you left.”</p>
<p>Marl raised an eyebrow in disbelief. “Evolved how? You found the meteorite that conked them, or Hal admitted that their whole delirium thing was a prank?”</p>
<p>Hal’s lips pressed shut into a thin line, ears drooping anxiously. Gossan closed their eyes and brought a gloved hand to rub their forehead. “…Let’s go with neither,” the founder sighed. “It’s a little more complicated than that.”</p>
<p>At first, Marl frowned in confusion, struggling to comprehend how there could somehow be a third option; but then, as they studied their faces one by one, as well as the embarrassed but knowing glance they exchanged in silence, their mouth hung open in bewilderment as they finally understood what this third option seemed to be – a third option which, evidently, did not deserve to be considered as such even for a single second.</p>
<p>“Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don’t tell me you actually <i>believe them</i>? Gossan, they thought Firn’d already launched! And that Riebeck was on <i>Giant’s Deep</i>, for some reason.”</p>
<p>“I know what they said,” the coach sighed tensely, struggling to think of the way they could come any close to even <i>begin</i> to explain and justify their choice. “It’s just… Listen, hear me out, but they said some other things while you were gone, things that should be impossible for them to know—”</p>
<p>There was a humorous huff, followed by an exasperated roll of their eyes. “What, they told you about your ‘secret’ meeting from two days ago? Sorry to break it to you, but the fact that you and Porphy have a thing for each other is a secret to absolutely nobody.”</p>
<p>Gossan’s ears promptly gained a purple tint, mouth slamming shut in shock and embarrassment. After a few seconds of stunned silence, they slightly shook their head with a grunt as an attempt to regain their senses. “—A-alright, you know what, this is– this isn’t important right now.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, really, if anything I’m glad someone <i>finally</i> bothered to unplug the geyser in the room. Quite surprised Hal would be the one to do it, though. And even more surprised that you’d take <i>that</i> as proof that everything else they said makes any sense! I mean, <i>really</i>, Gossan?”</p>
<p>The founder took a deep breath through their nose, rubbing their forehead as an attempt to hide the fact that the red value of their face’s overall color was rapidly increasing. “Hal, this might… take a minute. Go see Hornfels in the meantime and tell them about the statue, okay? I’ll be there soon.”</p>
<p>Marl huffed, offended enough to let their disbelief resonate like shocked laughter. “Oh, <i>oh</i>, so now you’re just acting like <i>I’m</i> the problem to deal with!? Gossan, if whatever got them’s contagious or something—”</p>
<p>As the flight coach tried to defend their pride and explain the situation at the same time, unsurprisingly ending up failing at both as a result, Hal shyly stepped backwards and out of the room.</p>
<p class=vs>But then, as they were about to reach the stairs leading to the observatory… They paused for a short instant.</p>
<p>When they had mentioned Hornfels’ name, Hal realized that Gossan had just brought up a rather intriguing, perhaps even worrying point:</p>
<p>Where <i>was</i> Hornfels?</p>
<p>In this future that had never been, from the very moment when Hal thought they remembered stepping in this room, Hornfels had been standing right here, looking at the back of the statue. While, evidently… This time, they were not.</p>
<p class=vs>Hal had a very clear idea as to where else they could be, this was not the question. With Firn’s first launch, actually, it should have been <i>more</i> surprising for Hornfels to be anywhere other than at their post on ground control, making sure that everything was ready… and, perhaps, making sure that Firn would be kept away from the launch codes all the way until the right time came.</p>
<p>If Hornfels had been done prepping the statue at least a sunrise or two before they had made their way to the museum, then what had they been doing downstairs the first time, that they would not be doing the second?</p>
<p class=vs>As Hal resumed their climb up the stairs, they could not help but ponder yet another question, under a different angle: if they had indeed seen the future somehow, and nobody else had, then why would their memory of Hornfels be off? Was the future supposed to be deterministic, or was every person given enough free will to act differently despite being set under the exact same circumstances, even without knowing it?</p>
<p>Or, perhaps more simply, were they and Gossan wrong, and had this vision truly been some kind of partial fluke, in part impossibly accurate, but for the most part utter nonsense?</p>
<hr>
<p>In truth, there was no such thing as truly unpredictable behavior: for behavior was defined by one’s choices – even the choice to leave things to ‘chance’, ironically, provided ‘chance’ itself could count as true randomness, which it most often could not; and for no choice could ever be made without an aware consciousness to collapse their own uncertainty into a set decision.</p>
<p class=vs>True, unaltered and unbiased randomness could bend matter to its absolute unpredictability, born out of the simultaneous existence of all possibilities at once, perhaps; but rarely ever could it be enough to impede on an observer’s choices, for it was not supposed to choose in their stead. Quantum objects were meant to be everything at once, so that conscious observers alone could ultimately decide upon which reality to forge – in the current universe, as well as in the next one.</p>
<p>This simple rule was an integral part of the laws of this world, and still applied even in a solar system in which the Eye of the Universe’s influence had spread, as a result of its initial cry into the void of space having been muffled for too long. Save for the hypothetical scenario of a direct confrontation with the truly random fluctuations of a quantum object, no conscious mind could be swayed so easily: indecision was, after all, what the Eye needed to avoid, for its purpose to be fulfilled safely – most of all the kind of indecision which would be caused by its own uncollapsed nature.</p>
<p>Therefore, how indeed could a Hearthian’s mind be changed enough for them to spontaneously behave in such a vastly different way, so as to no longer be in the same location? Was it truly so self-centered of Hal to instinctively believe that every detail should have remained strictly identical to their memories, and that only their own actions should be enough to cause change on a macroscopic scale?</p>
<p>It could be naively hypothesized that, courtesy of the museum housing a quantum shard with a tendency to appear in a truly random state upon each new observation, it somehow was to blame for this discrepancy. However… This hypothesis was incorrect.</p>
<p>Instead, strangely enough, the answer to this mystery lied somewhere else entirely: in a place so very far from the small museum on Timber Hearth, and in a time some sixteen minutes and forty-five seconds earlier.</p>

<!-- @SFOLD — 002 — CHAPTER 2²: Cyclone Riders —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— -->
<div class=chp id=ch2_2><h1>Chapter 2²</h1><h2>Cyclone Riders</h2><hr>
<p>Through the thick stormy clouds, a massive explosion from orbit was reflected in purple flashes amongst the sky of Giant’s Deep.</p>
<p>With a short gasp and a blink, Gabbro startled at the sudden change in both gravity and, most importantly, in luminosity – the second to occur in, well, less than a second.</p>
<p>There were many reasons for Gabbro to feel disorientation and panic, in this moment; but, on the one hand because <i>‘Gabbro is Gabbro’</i> and <i>Gabbro doesn’t panic</i>, and on the other because there were so many reasons to panic that they could not even set their mind on which one to panic about… For a moment, they simply remained still, assessing one by one every element they could see.</p>
<p class=vs>A second ago, they had been in almost complete darkness – behind the shadow of their favorite planet, sitting on a bench inside one of the two (three?) chambers of the Orbital Probe Cannon.</p>
<p class=vs>Less than a second ago, their eyes had been burned by intense light brighter than their imagination could have fathomed – though it was not long before more than just their eyes were burned away.</p>
<p class=vs>Then, even less than less than a second ago, the light vanished into not darkness, but bright green skies – the familiar and normal amount of bright, caused by Giant’s Deep’s lack of day-night cycle, courtesy of the sun’s light being reflected and refracted within the atmosphere until the electric clouds themselves became a source of light in their own right.</p>
<p>And instantly after, with barely enough time to even process that their location had somehow changed, here had come this second flash of light, purple and dim this time, but noticeably distinct from the eternal storm’s usual thunder strikes.</p>
<p>The first thing Gabbro realized and found all at once curious, incomprehensible, and terrifying, was the fact that they were not sitting on a bench anymore. Somehow, they had not just been transported from one location to another — <i>their body had been moved</i>. They were standing up, an arm pointing at the sky, signalscope in hand, frequency adjusted for requesting a connection with… ground control?</p>
<p>As though they had been suffering from some kind of sleep paralysis, and only now were able to fully regain control of their limbs, Gabbro finally displayed a rare and uncharacteristic external sign of distress: they opened their hand and stepped back rapidly, expression of fear beneath their helmet looking for a split second like they expected their signalscope to explode.</p>
<p>Then… they simply stared at it. Nope, not going to explode. Not going to magically move on its own and turn to them to finally explain what in the void brambling geysers had just happened, either. Not that the latter would have been any more reassuring, mind you.</p>
<p>Gabbro, legs trembling, looked around proper, recognizing their current location to be their favorite island, the one they had set up camp on.</p>
<p>No, really. <i>What</i> in the world had just happened, and most importantly, what were they even doing with their signalscope in hand?</p>
<p>The instant this last question was being formed inside their mind with enough insistence, it felt as though a cyclone was coming around and sweeping them away – even though, all at the same time, no wind was currently here to so much as rotate their helmet’s anemometer.</p>
<p>Overlaid on top of reality, they saw their own hands holding the signalscope once again, even as they could still feel their arms lying by their side and their fingers being fully extended into anything but a grabbing gesture, their eyes staring at the sky, and yet their true head simultaneously staring down at the very same signalscope which was lying on the ground instead, definitely away from their grip.</p>
<p class=vs>Mouth agape and throat tightening, they were silent;</p>
<p>Coy smile plastered on their face and vocal cords humming, they were speaking.</p>
<p><i>“Hey, Horns, you still here? Gossan must’ve left by now, right?”</i></p>
<p>Gabbro felt a shiver run down their spine when they finally understood: they had, after all, experienced this once before. They recognized these words, just as much as they knew where the soon-to-be conversation was going to go — for this entire upcoming scene, too, had been experienced once before – technically twice, even.</p>
<p>Amongst the winds of the past and present alike, Gabbro heard what they now remembered to be naught but a far too vivid memory: <i class=radio>“Gabbro, I really need to focus on Firn’s first launch. What is it? Do you have a problem with my request from earlier?”</i></p>
<p>The past Gabbro marked an awkward pause. The present Gabbro knew exactly why. <i>“Yeah… Yeah. Yeah, it’s about that statue again.”</i> Another pause, even more awkward than the last. Void did Gabbro sometimes wish they could lie properly. <i>“Sooo… Just <b>how badly</b> do you need another one?”</i></p>
<p>A loud, not-truly-existent sigh. <i class=radio>“Just say it if you’re too lazy to get to work, will you?”</i></p>
<p class=vs>For once, both past and present Gabbro wished that ‘laziness’ could have been the culprit; but alas, the cyclone which had swept away their ship and launched it out of their sight at some point during the night was, in fact, the real reason.</p>
<p>Not that either version of Gabbro felt like admitting it, because admitting it would make them look even more irresponsible than just pretending that they didn’t want to get the job done. They normally knew better than to spend their nights at their campfire instead of inside their ship, or at least to not do so before having securely attached all struts to the island beforehand, <i>specifically</i> so as to avoid being separated from it while asleep. But…</p>
<p class=vs>Well. Um. The previous evening might have involved a few alien substances they had dug up during the previous day’s exploration which Porphy likely would have classified as ‘not recommended for Hearthian consumption, <i>especially not</i> when coupled with the carcinogens created upon roasting it like one of Gabbro’s regularly burnt marshmallows.’</p>
<p>So, yeah. Gabbro largely preferred sticking to the laziness excuse instead.</p>
<p><i class=radio>“Gabbro, as incredible as your discovery was, the fact that you chipped it… I’ve been thinking that it may be the reason why it won’t open its eyes. I am starting to believe that you must have damaged it more than we initially thought.”</i></p>
<p>Both in the past and in the present, this remark made them exhale a silent, tired sigh, alongside an eye roll. It felt surprisingly nice, for just one moment, to have both their body and the illusion of it find at least one or two actions to agree upon, small and fleeting as they were.</p>
<p class=vs><i>“Come on,”</i> their past self started,</p>
<p class=vs>“Come on,” they voiced in sync— and their real mouth slammed shut, eyes instantly widening in terror. Even as they did so, they could still feel their lips tremble, and with a shiver they realized that they still felt the urge to keep talking, repeating the words they once had before.</p>
<p><i>“—it’s not <i>that</i> bad,”</i> they simultaneously said and tried their hardest not to. <i>“I bet you couldn’t even find <b>where</b> it’s been chipped.”</i></p>
<p class=vs>Scary how even their current body felt subconsciously compelled to re-enact the past as it played out, even if there was no Hornfels to talk to this time, and no signalscope in hand for their fingers to nervously tinker with. So much for having been glad a moment before to have this exact thing happen – just, out of the pleasant surprise to have their past self behave in a similar enough way to their current thoughts as to give the illusion of following their own present self’s volition, not by having it somehow happen in the exact reverse.</p>
<p>They quickly found solace in the fact that stopping their body from copying their past self’s actions was not <i>too</i> difficult, quite easy in fact: after all, they had been doing it perfectly at first without even trying, and it had only become a problem once they had made a conscious effort of noticing the similarity… Nonetheless, their positively horrified state of mind definitely made it much harder than it needed to be.</p>
<p>Even as a memory, Hornfels’ eye roll was almost audible. <i class=radio>“Gabbro, the broken part you gave Slate was <b>gigantic</b>,”</i> (No, it absolutely was not, Slate even had complained about it being too small to do anything worthwhile with – until they found out just how much more powerful of a processor and storage unit it was than they had first assumed, that was), <i class=radio>“of course I know where…”</i></p>
<p>But then, the illusory Hornfels trailed off, and Gabbro felt an equally illusory smug grin make its way on their illusory face. <i>“Nope. You don’t. You’ve been staring at it for weeks and you couldn’t tell the difference.”</i></p>
<p><i class=radio>“I will find it,”</i> the curator grumbled stubbornly, <i class=radio>“just you wait.”</i> And then, instead of words, the memory of their radio transmitted the sounds of a microphone being picked up, then of footsteps stomping down the observatory’s staircase.</p>
<p><i>“Had to be somewhere within the mane, I think,”</i> they said helpfully and condescendingly at once. <i>“With the alien anatomy and all the fluff, I’m sure it’s hard to tell what part of it is supposed to be missing anyway. If even <b>you</b> can’t tell, you can be sure that no one will notice.”</i></p>
<p>The radio from inside their head shared some annoyed grunts and unintelligible grumbles of protestation, and for a little while, this was all that Gabbro could experience: themself standing upright near their camp, on one side looking humorously at the sky with a signalscope in hand, on the other trying to remain composed with clenching and unclenching hands, trying not to think about the fact that one of them was distinctly itching to hold something that wasn’t there.</p>
<p><i>“So, having any luck down there?”</i> their past self prompted jokingly when they started to think that the silence was getting overbearing, only to receive as answer nothing but more grumbles, of which Gabbro could barely distinguish something about wishing Slate hadn’t taken the broken part before they were given the time to see where on the statue it used to fit. <i>“…Actually, you know, Hornfels, I’ve also been thinking… It wouldn’t be very nice of me to just start looking for another, especially today.”</i></p>
<p>Gabbro could so perfectly picture Memory Hornfels’ exasperated glare into the void, for lack of being able to glare at them directly. <i class=radio>“…Would you care to elaborate? Do I even want you to?”</i></p>
<p><i>“Today’s supposed to be the first one’s big day, right? First day as a museum exhibit, biggest star of the whole place, and you already want me to look for a replacement to steal its spotlight? I can only imagine how betrayed and jealous that must make it feel.”</i></p>
<p>Silence resumed for a moment more, this time full of bafflement at the audacity. <i class=radio>“I don’t even know why I bother,”</i> the curator eventually grumbled in a frankly appalled whisper. Then, changing their tone to a far more annoyed and stern one, they soon spoke some more… and Gabbro understood that they may have gotten past the limits of their patience. <i class=radio>“Gabbro, you think I don’t know what you’ve been playing at here? You’ve wasted enough of my time stalling and looking for the stupidest excuses you could think of! So now, I want you to <b>get out of your camp</b> and <b>go back to work</b>. Understood?”</i></p>
<p class=vs>Then, the radio from the past was turned off at once, and the illusory Gabbro found themself alone with the uncomfortable realization that they had somehow managed to get themself in even more trouble than they had started with.</p>
<p>They found themself hoping that the planet would take pity on them and have the politeness to give them their ship back, sooner rather than later, if only so they could avoid another earful from ground control now berating them for <i>two</i> problems rather than one.</p>
<p>And then, with this last thought from past and present alike trailing off into nothingness…</p>
<p>Just as abruptly as a real one would, the cyclone finally left and vanished: and instantly after, Gabbro’s mind was once again dropped and drenched into full reality, freed from the grip of the winds swirling within.</p>
<p>Left all alone in shock, now back to only having to deal with one very real body and no urge to move in ways they only had wished to some time in the past, but no longer in the present… Gabbro simply stared vacantly for a while.</p>
<p>What <i>was</i> this whole sequence? What had triggered it in the first place?</p>
<p>Instantly, the answer was dropped onto them from the skies, in the form of the unclear memory of a thought they had once formulated: <i>‘What were they doing with their signalscope in hand?’</i></p>
<p>Understanding that this question from the past was supposed to be their answer, Gabbro… kept staring for a while longer, not even knowing how to react to this.</p>
<p>They had to hand it to whoever, or whatever had been responsible for this: what it had done seemed to have successfully provided at least some kind of answer to both of their questions. It had not answered with words, but it had rather… <i>given context</i> to a past event they remembered having lived through a few sunrises ago, during which they had indeed been standing upright with a signalscope in hand, in what was (probably not so) coincidentally the exact same position as the one they had found themself in upon being… somehow sent back here.</p>
<p>This just happened to also raise an unhearthian amount of <i>other</i> questions – if only the one related to <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> their own memories had started replaying before their eyes just now, especially in such a vivid way, and the one trying to identify <i>who</i> was behind this – but they instantly felt another cyclone coming, somehow some kind of triple cyclone with the mental and blurry image of three closed eyes opening to stare straight into their brain, this time; and before they could be thrown into the orbit of their own subconscious <i>again</i>, they vehemently shook their head and stepped back, as if walking further away from the signalscope could let them escape their own mind.</p>
<p>…Strangely enough, their loudly and squeakily voiced <i>“<span class=scaps>nope</span>”</i> seemed to successfully chase the cyclone away. Huh.</p>
<p class=vs>So it seemed like… <i>something</i> was listening to their inner questions – listening to their <i>mind</i> – and somehow thought that it would be a perfectly acceptable idea to provide answers by forcing them to relive their own recent memories?</p>
<p>If so, then Gabbro guessed that they… might need to watch what kind of thought they were going to have, from now on. Joy. Not horrifying in the slightest, not at all.</p>
<p class=vs>Deciding to try not to linger on their <i>questions</i> — for more reasons than one, seriously <i>what</i> on Hearth was– <i>no no no stop asking</i> — Gabbro tried to instead focus on what clues they already had.</p>
<p>Too bad staying focused was, uh, not really their strong suit.</p>
<p>So. It was pondering time, which meant that they needed the proper equipment; thankfully, they reassured themself as they walked down the path to the beach, everything should be already there, since they had prepared everything earlier this morning—</p>
<p class=vs>—Gabbro looked ahead, and saw no hammock waiting for them. Bummer.</p>
<p>This also added yet another question to the pile: the mystery of the vanishing Personal Pondering Equipment (PPE for short). It did not seem to be the work of a cyclone, because if it had, clearly the trees they had attached it to would have shown far more obvious signs of tear, and likely lost quite a few leaves in the struggle.</p>
<p>With a dejected sigh, Gabbro turned back around to walk up to their campfire, hoping to find their spare hammock; but once they reached it and their belongings, both their mouth and eyes opened wide in shock when they discovered that everything had somehow found its way back inside their bag: hammock, flute, lantern, canned rations… All of it, inexplicably tucked in their protective cases away from the danger of the cyclones – exactly the way it would be at the beginning of each morning, after they would have lit up the camp for breakfast, but before they would have gone to work proper.</p>
<p>…Exactly the way it had been <i>before they had radioed Hornfels</i>, they finally realized.</p>
<p>Was this a ridiculous idea? Maybe. But everything lately had been pretty ridiculous to begin with. This idea warranted its stay, Gabbro decided as they begrudgingly carried their equipment back down to the beach and started prepping their hammock all over again.</p>
<p>One tree was attached, then the other; balance between softness, flexibility and durability alike was rapidly tested, then adjusted; and once satisfied, Gabbro hopped in. End of the flute went to the specially built-in part of their helmet, and with a few seconds of calm breathing as warm-up, the music started. Playing was an integral part of the pondering process, after all, given the fact that its repetitiveness and relative simplicity helped them focus.</p>
<p>Alright. Finally, they were set, and ready for the pondering.</p>
<p>The weirdness had started with that first impossibly bright and <i>lethally hot</i> light. Perhaps it had even started a bit before, actually, if the mysterious and coincidentally quite close to the end disappearance of ground control had anything to do with it.</p>
<p class=vs>That light had hurt so much, for how brief it was. Lethally so, they were certain, it had hurt way too much for it not to be. Which meant…</p>
<p>Had they… died?</p>
<p>And yet, now– they were <i>fine</i>. Physically speaking.</p>
<p>When they had pondered why they had just found themself standing up near their camp holding their signalscope, whoever or whatever had taken control of their mind had forced them to relive a recent memory from a few sunrises ago, which had started with them standing up in this exact spot, holding their signalscope and radioing Hornfels.</p>
<p>So… They had died, and now they had been sent back in the past, at that exact moment? And there now was a mysterious thing hiding inside their mind forcing them to relive their own memories every once in a while?</p>
<p>Gabbro stopped playing, having reached… <i>some</i> sort of conclusion. Their flute dropped on their chest, as they simply stared at the clouds.</p>
<p class=vs>Their thoughts wandered around for some more time, an amount that they soon lost track of.</p>
<p>They had died, and they were no longer dead… maybe? It wasn’t like they knew what being dead was supposed to feel like. But the part about having been sent back in time did seem to be the only explanation they could think of to fully explain their sudden… transportation from the Orbital Probe Cannon to their island on Giant’s Deep – as well as the undone hammock finding itself tucked away for the night.</p>
<p>Well. Now, see, maybe someone else would have done something <i>other</i> than keep lying in their hammock, but them… What could they possibly do about it?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>For once, the mental cyclones did not come this time around to answer <i>that</i> question. Of course. It seemed like it was too much to ask, for them to be <i>actually</i> helpful.</p>
<p>Their thoughts eventually went to their signalscope, unceremoniously dropped on the ground like a freshly caught fish trying to flap around and jump at their head for a bite.</p>
<p>Crazy thought, but… They might as well use it? Surely, someone <i>else</i> would have noticed if time had just had some kind of hiccup and sent the entire universe a few sunrises back.</p>
<p>They would have to give their signalscope a short but genuine apology for the rough handling, too. It wasn’t its fault, the poor thing. Gabbro hoped they hadn’t damaged it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Hornfels sighed in satisfaction, smiling at a work well done. The weather could not be more optimal, all communications were set, the tower was in perfect shape, and most importantly, the launch codes were secured.</p>
<p class=vs>Not that they expected Firn to have been able to find them ahead of time, mind you, not with all the precautions all founders had decided upon unanimously. It had taken them quite a while to find a plan which all had judged infallible, but it had been done – up to the final precaution that not even Slate or Gossan knew the launch codes themselves, and that Hornfels technically would not either if it weren’t for the sole fact that they, as ground control, had needed to be the one to change those codes themself, and that they currently were the guardian of the only slip of paper in existence which could reveal them.</p>
<p>All this, just to really hammer in the fact that, if Firn wanted to get that elevator to move, there was only one Hearthian in the entire universe who could make that happen, and that in order to get said Hearthian to cooperate, they too needed to abide by Outer Wilds Ventures protocol.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it still was a relief to find the tiny slip of paper exactly in the same location and position they had left it before going to sleep, down to the millimeter; and even with all that, Hornfels buried it even deeper yet, under a few more dozen sheets of paper, before closing the drawer once again. Just for good measure.</p>
<p>Mission “Firn’s Launch Day” <i>had</i> to go without a hitch. No excuses, no unforeseen events, and most of all: no shenanigans.</p>
<p>For their first launch, Firn had promised that they would be sticking to the protocol down to the last comma, sure; but Firn had also promised a lot of things in the past — such as promising not to touch Tektite’s static scout launcher in their absence on the day Slate had finished installing it, only for Tektite to later find out that, indeed, Firn had not touched the <i>launcher</i>, they had gone directly for the scout itself and used its powerful flash to startle Tuff into getting close enough to the Zero-G cave for the poor Hearthian to feel nauseous for the rest of the day. Firn saying that they had not expected it to be so effective did nothing to alleviate the shaking of their limbs.</p>
<p>The founder’s thoughts were interrupted when they heard footsteps coming their way. At first expecting to see the troublemaker in question, they were surprised to find instead a different hatchling, one who was far more pleasant to spend time with:</p>
<p>“Hal! Why, good morning!” they greeted happily. “Did you see the statue downstairs? It’s finally ready for display!”</p>
<p>Hornfels’ smile faltered upon seeing the expression on their face. It already looked troubled before; but following their greeting, when Hal raised their eyes to them, it reshaped itself into a distraught, shyly widening stare. The glint in their eyes seemed to be begging for something – something which should have been expected, or at least something they had hoped to find – and to have collapsed into despair as soon as Hornfels failed to provide it.</p>
<p>They turned to them fully, frowning with concern. “Is something wrong, Hal?”</p>
<p>The hatchling startled as their eyes widened even more, this time in sudden realization as they seemed to be pulled out of their thoughts and back to reality. Their hands were raised to their chest, fingers fiddling nervously. “Y-yeah, well– I mean, n-<i>no</i>, I’m fine, I think, but…”</p>
<p>Their gaze softened, smile coming back with relief. “You’re nervous about the launch, is that it?”</p>
<p>Hal did not respond, uncomfortable stare plunging back to the ground. Had the fear going through their eyes not been so deeply impenetrable, Hornfels would have thought nothing more of it; but they could see that it went further than just their usual anxiety.</p>
<p>“Bad dream?” they thus offered instead, patting the desk to their side as an invite for the hatchling to come closer and lean against it next to them.</p>
<p>Hal strangled a humorless chuckle, corners of their mouth distorting into a nervous, trembling smirk. “I… guess you could say that, in a way.”</p>
<p>“Come on. Everything is ready, all that I have left to do now is kill some time. You can tell me.”</p>
<p class=vs>At first, they remained still, even looking as though they instead wanted to distance themself as far away from them as physically conceivable.</p>
<p class=vs>But then… Their lips were pressed together, their eyes were shut tight as they took a tense inhale, and they finally stepped forward, watching them warily all the while.</p>
<p>Hornfels could not begin to fathom what kind of nightmare could have possibly caused such turmoil within them, let alone when it appeared that, somehow, Hal seemed to believe that <i>they</i> were the problem.</p>
<p>There was another tense breath. “So… Firn had already launched, but they’d gone to Giant’s Deep,” the hatchling mumbled with sorrow. “They’d met up with Gabbro, and together they explored an island with another Nomai statue – but then there was a cyclone that threw them into orbit, they were stranded without any fuel and just over half a sunrise’s worth of oxygen, and you had to send <i>Riebeck</i> to rescue them – <i>Riebeck!</i> Heh…”</p>
<p>Hal paused. They turned their neck, looking up into their eyes, once again searching for <i>something</i>, whatever it was. Hornfels tried to understand what this could possibly be, and kept their silence as they were pondering; but when they could not find anything, they softly tilted their head with a tiny nod, encouraging them to continue.</p>
<p>“That sounds like a very eventful first launch indeed, and a terrifying one for you to be sure. So then… Did Riebeck not make it?”</p>
<p>Hal winced, clutching their chest and turning their head away. Evidently, this had been the wrong thing to say.</p>
<p>Hornfels brought a hand on their back, giving a sad smile. “Oh, Hal… Firn is still on Timber Hearth and <i>promised</i> they would follow protocol. I spoke to Gabbro less than two sunrises ago, and Riebeck— Well, if it can help, we can radio them together, they will tell you in person that they’re all right.”</p>
<p>“No,” they instantly snapped with force– instantly biting their lip upon realizing that they had raised their voice. They had not raised it enough to make it a shout – but definitely enough to sound like an out-of-control cry of despair. “S-sorry. I know they’re alright. They <i>had</i> made it, it’s just… You don’t…”</p>
<p>Hornfels gently moved their hand to wrap their shoulder, silently waiting for Hal to finish their sentence; but they never did, and for some unfathomable reason, it almost seemed like they were trying not to recoil from the touch.</p>
<p>“<i>‘I don’t’</i> what?” they soon prodded. “Understand, perhaps? I’m trying, Hal, even though I can tell that there is something I am failing to see here. Could you enlighten me?”</p>
<p>Hal turned their head away, heaving a pained sigh. “Forget it. It was stupid of me to hope you might’ve… N-never mind. I already know it didn’t really happen.”</p>
<p>“You don’t look like you do,” Hornfels murmured quietly. “I did not actually expect you to come here so soon, with you and Firn being such late-risers. Perhaps… you just need some more sleep?”</p>
<p class=vs>Hal’s ears twitched violently, practically drooping low enough to brush their cowering shoulders, as their eyes quickly sent them a betrayed look.</p>
<p>Their hands grabbed the edge of the desk as they pushed themself forward; but before they could leave their side, Hornfels softly but insistently seized their wrist, forcing them to turn around; and thus, Hal’s distraught expression met Hornfels’: stern, but apologetic.</p>
<p>“Unless there is <i>something else</i> you are not telling me, Hal. I’ve never seen it <i>this</i> serious before, but I know that face.” Gently releasing their grip, they instead focused all their efforts into trying to find the least upsetting way to ask their question: “Do you… have bad news of some kind?”</p>
<p class=vs>Ever since the moment they had made their way up in the observatory, it had been obvious that they had come to tell them something in particular — something they so desperately wanted to say, but were perhaps too scared or anxious to find the right way to so much as bring up the topic.</p>
<p class=vs>This was far from the first occurrence; sadly, it was quite typical of them to remain frozen and silent whenever they were the bearer of unpleasant knowledge. This resulted not of a desire to hide the truth – instead, it simply came out of their inability to find the words to share it.</p>
<p>Normally, the best way to get them unstuck and let them share what troubled them so was, unfortunately, for the other party to either successfully guess at least part of the issue, or happen to tackle the relevant topic. Alas… if this went deeper than just a nightmare or the anxiety related to Firn’s first launch, then Hornfels frankly had no clue what the topic could be this time around.</p>
<p>Hal closed their eyes again, opening their mouth wide and taking another deep breath before speaking. “S-so, uh– It’s c-<i>complicated</i>, but I guess maybe it starts with the statue…”</p>
<p>Footsteps resonated behind their backs, coming from the staircase. Hal turned around and perked up, wondering if Gossan had finally decided to join them; but instead, when a different Hearthian head sprouted out of the hole and came into view, they froze at once.</p>
<p class=vs>To Hornfels’ disappointment, this interruption could not have chosen a worse moment to distract them from their conversation – for they knew far too well what this meant for the amount of time they would have to wait before finally obtaining their answers.</p>
<p>Whether Hal being just about to mention a statue was meant to be foreshadowing or unlucky coincidence was a question only a Hearthian such as Gabbro would bother to ponder about; but the fact still was that at the exact moment when the hatchling had caught sight of the newest astronaut, they promptly turned into one.</p>
<p>“Hey Hal! Hornfels,” Firn saluted with a cheerful wave and a polite nod. “Don’t mind me, I’m just here for the launch codes.”</p>

<!-- @SFOLD — 002 — CHAPTER 3²: Lunar Exploration ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— -->
<div class=chp id=ch3_2><h1>Chapter 3²</h1><h2>Lunar Exploration</h2><hr>
<p class=vs>The observatory, courtesy of being a large circular room standing on top of an already large and unfrequented museum, usually was a place for peace and quiet, ideal for reflection.</p><p>However, for far more reasons than one, this morning was anything but usual; and one of the many habits this day would break was how the dim emptiness, starting from this moment, would be suddenly brimming with activity and chaos.</p>
<p>Given the nature of this very special day, Firn’s arrival was entirely planned – and if anything, surprisingly for someone who was supposedly so eager to go to space, they were rather late; but many, many more visits to come would be anything but expected.</p>
<p>As they reoriented their body but not yet their head towards the newcomer, Hornfels sighed tiredly. “This will only take a minute, Hal. You can use this time to find your words.”</p>
<p>The founder’s eyes were turned away too fast to notice that Hal had not even heard them, too focused on staring at their best friend with frozen shock.</p>
<p>Firn cocked their head to the side, frowning ever so slightly at them during the split second when they thought Hornfels might not notice. “Did I interrupt something? You two look busy.”</p>
<p>“It’s already done, we might as well get this over with,” Hornfels grumbled as their eyes and hands were lowered to the pouch attached to their belt.</p>
<p>They rummaged quickly through it, carefully pushing aside the many rolled up sheets of paper and other notes all the while, until they pulled out a small key; then, turning towards a shadowed corner of the ground control’s main desk, they pushed aside a small crate, revealing an equally small cupboard containing a few drawers, and swiftly unlocked it.</p>
<p>Firn had been looking at them in silence, disbelief growing on their face in the form of a slowly expanding smile, until they finally snorted and exploded in laughter. “<i>Wow</i>, so you really kept them camouflaged and everything, huh?”</p>
<p>Hornfels did not bother turning to them, still struggling to find and dig up the single, tiny slip of paper on which they had written the codes, since they had deliberately buried it under so many unrelated books and unbound sheets. It took them about a dozen seconds to finally find it, and when they stood back up, they exchanged a quick confused glance with Hal, who happened to be standing closeby and to have been staring at them during their search, always in the same stunned and silent daze.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, they subtly shook their head and finally, with a sigh, they handed the tiny yet so crucial slip of paper to the soon-to-be newest astronaut. “You may be the only Hearthian in existence who would want a repeat of <i>Riebeck’s</i> launch day,” they finally retorted with a low grunt.</p>
<p>Firn eagerly but politely seized the note, securing it within their hand before they pouted and spoke any further. “In my defense, they actually <i>appreciated</i> the fact that it gave them one more day in the village. And honestly, I could’ve gone with far worse, like crickets or – ew – <i>fish</i>. Silkmoths don’t do anything but stand around looking cute and fluffy, they don’t even eat or poop, they just exist to mate and lay eggs.”</p>
<p>Hornfels deadpanned, glaring at the piece of paper in their hand as if they wanted to snatch it right back. “Yes, and <i>speaking of eggs</i>–”</p>
<p>“<i>I thought Slate would’ve been more thorough in cleaning up and I didn’t know the cracks between the wall planks were wide enough for them to crawl behind,</i>” Firn quickly slipped in before the founder could finish their sentence. Then, tilting their head to the side and diverting their look, they mumbled with a small pout: “…Also, at least that gave Esker a new hobby. And I’m pretty sure Riebeck got to keep one as a pet, too.”</p>
<p>Hornfels crossed their arms. “Firn. You <i>spiked their mallows</i> to make sure the sound of the elevator wouldn’t wake them up. Do you even realize how dangerous it would have been if they <i>had</i> launched regardless?”</p>

<div id=WIP_POINT></div>
<p>The hatchling was about to mumble with an actually apologetic undertone that they had made sure not to give them too much, that <i>obviously</i> they did not want both them and Slate to collapse near an unattended campfire, and that they had stood around in the bushes ensuring that they would fall asleep normally instead. However, before any of these words could leave their mouth, hurried footsteps resonated behind them.</p>
<p>“At <i>least</i> let me talk to Hornfels,” Gossan’s scolding voice soon resonated from within the staircase long before their head could fall into view. When it did, it was full of exasperation and embarrassment.</p>



<p>Hornfels’ eyes bounced from one Hearthian to the other, gradually frowning with more and more confusion as the second went by. “I’m sorry for the rude wording, Gossan, but what are you two doing here?”</p>
<p>“It’s about Hal,” Gossan started—</p>
<!-- <p>“And about the fact that the both of them went a bit cuckoo,” Marl interrupted with an eye roll.</p> -->
<p>“And about you and Porphy,” Marl interrupted with an eye roll.</p>
<p>“I mean, no surprises there, you all know it was me,” Firn shrugged with a large grin. “Just thought I’d wait till I was in space to let you know about the scout I’d hid in the perfect spot to catch their rendez-vous.”</p>

<!-- <p>“I’m sorry for the wait, Hal. I wanted to come much sooner, but I was…<i> distracted</i>,” they grunted while glaring at the two young Hearthians behind their back.</p>
<p>“As much as I want to get off this rock,” Firn shrugged with a smug grin, “I just couldn’t abandon Marl in their rightful quest to bring you up to speed. You totally should tell Porphy to reconsider what they should label today’s batch after.”</p>
<p>Gossan decided to ignore the remark entirely, only giving another sigh. “I tried my best, but Marl wouldn’t hear any of it, and when <i>Firn</i> arrived, I couldn’t get a single word in edgeways to bring the conversation back on topic.”</p>
-->

<wip></wip>
<p>Barely a second after Firn looked down at the note, they snorted and chuckled in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Oh geez– Marl, you’ve gotta check this out,” they snorted while showing them the note’s contents, laughter progressively making it harder for them to equally speak and breathe. “That is <i>hilarious</i>.”</p>
<p>The lumberjack’s eyes fell on the scribbles, then widened into disbelief, and they finally sneered in turn. “Wait, are you for real? Hah, not even <i>one</i> character’s a letter!”</p>
<p>“It was Slate’s idea,” Hornfels nodded while crossing their arms. “We all thought you wouldn’t be able to guess a password that isn’t even <i>close</i> to looking like a word, on the off-chance you would manage to find time to give it a try during the night.”</p>
<p>The cadet nodded with a wide smirk and a proudly impressed snicker. “Good job. Glad you’re all getting smarter, that makes it more fun.”</p>
<p>Hornfels’ furrow dug itself on their face even deeper. “Don’t make us regret sending you into space, Firn.”</p>
<p>“Come on, don’t act like you’re not glad you’re getting rid of me,” they huffed with the same smirk and a roll of their lower eyes. “The village’ll finally get to be boring again.”</p>



<p class=wip>[All the while Firn is in the observatory, Hal has clammed up and is frozen. Firn almost ignores them for the most part, but soon they come to them to give them a light pat on the shoulder.]</p>
<p>“Aw, Hal. Can you not give me that look until <i>after</i> I’ve actually crashed?” Firn asked them with a discreet laugh, giving them a joking pat on the shoulder. “No, for real, I’ll be <i>fine</i>. I’ll even keep you updated in real time! …Assuming I’m not too busy jumping around and having fun with the low gravity, ha.”</p>
<p class=wip>[Hal is too distraught to know how to respond, so they just give a silent awkward smile with a noncommittal hum.] While they had not uttered this exact sentence <i>word for word</i> before, they definitely remembered them saying something far too similar to it, just a few sunrises ago, perhaps less than ten minutes before the statue had opened its eyes. Somehow, this felt almost more uncanny than if Firn had repeated themself entirely.</p>




<wip>Hornfels asking Firn what they intend to do in space:</wip>
<p>“Eh, I think I’ll start small with the Attlerock, just to make sure I’ve got all the controls right.” “Besides, I bet Hal is <i>dying</i> to know what kind of device the Nomai were calibrating there.”</p>
<p class=wip>(Sees Hal’s distraught expression.)</p>
<p>They stared back, frowning in confusion. “…Or not? Is something wrong?”</p>


<wip>Keep for Loop 3?</wip>
<p>They gave a soft snicker, blowing humorously though their nose. “Hal, it feels like you think I’m a ghost. I haven’t even launched yet, I can’t have already crashed to my death and come back to haunt you. Give that at least one or two more sunrises, will you?”</p>
<p>No reaction. Hal’s stare kept trembling, perhaps a little more than before, but their mouth remained motionless.</p>
<p>“Okay, for real though,” Firn quickly whispered in a far lower volume, “I’ll be <i>fine</i>. I’ll even promise to be extra careful this time around. Just…” “Hal. What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class=wip>[Hal lets them go, too heartbroken to tell them about the time loop. Firn is suspicious and worried, but takes the codes and leaves.]</p>















<wip>Hornfels’ radio beeps with an incoming call, and they chase off everyone.</wip>
<p>“Firn, just have your launch already.”</p>
<p class=wip>“Heh, alright, alright.” Firn puts their hand on Gossan’s shoulder one last time, giant grin on their face, saying something like “Just don’t forget to tell them about that batch name idea, yeah?”</p>
<p>“<i>Off</i> with you two!” Gossan barked, entire face flushing in saturated violet.</p>
<p class=wip>Firn turns around and runs down the stairs, soon followed by Marl, both snickering like a pair of hatchlings a decade younger than they really were. Hornfels’ eyes widen and they are about to say something, hand raised in protest, but they were both already long gone, and as such, they instead brought this same hand to rub the bridge of their nose as they sighed.</p>





<wip>Firn and Marl do leave eventually, grinning all the while. It could be because Gabbro is radioing and Hornfels is asking everyone to leave. Firn and Marl leave, Hal is hesitantly about to leave too but Gossan keeps them from fully descending the stairs, instead maintaining them within earshot — whispering that they will help them talk to Hornfels, after they asked them whether they managed to brief them on the situation and Hal just shakes their head in shame and silence.</wip>



<p>Something on the ground control’s dashboard beeped, and they jumped with a loud yelp.</p>
<p>Hornfels raised a peaceful hand to them as they turned around to check, and after a quick glance, they sighed tiredly. “Forgive me, Hal. This will only take a minute. You can take this time to find your words.” They then turned fully to the control panel and activated their microphone, accepted the call request, and greeted with an already exasperated question: “What is it, Gabbro? We’re in the middle of something, here. Do you have a problem with my request from earlier?”</p>
<p>For a moment, the radio crackled nothing but stunned static. It seemed like something about Hornfels’ latest sentence was wrong, but Hornfels themself sure could not imagine what.</p>
<p class=radio>“O…kay, uh, just gonna <span class=smol>ignore the fact that you said that exact sentence before</span>… So, Hornfels, bear with me for a sec, but do you remember dying?”</p>
<p>The elder’s mouth remained stuck as an opened frown distorted with sheer disappointment and disbelief. “Gabbro, if this is about the time when you asked me if each moment is the death of our past self and the birth of our future self, then you already know my thoughts about this kind of metaphor. You’re in space to do some field work, not some philosophical ponderings like these.”</p>
<p>Somehow, as they answered, Gabbro’s voice sounded rushed and genuinely confused. <span class=radio>“No, wait, I wasn’t…”</span> But their sentence trailed off; and soon, with a sigh, they concluded: <span class=radio>“…Never mind.”</span></p>
<p>With an eye roll, Hornfels brought a hand to the dashboard, ready to sever the connection. “Well, in this case, if that is all—”</p>
<p>“I remember too,” Hal blurted out.</p>
<p>Hornfels turned to them with four shut slits instead of eyes. “What… are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Hal sent them a quick glance, but soon ignored them completely, instead making their way towards the microphone with haste all the while staring at it with an expression overtaken with some kind of chilling, incomprehensible desperation. “Gabbro. Firn’s first launch. The statue workshop. Riebeck– The <i>Orbital Probe Cannon</i>– Do you…?”</p>
<p>The radio sent back something which sounded like a mixture between a whistle and a sigh of relief. <span class=radio>“Oh, cool, so it wasn’t just me.”</span></p>

<p class=vs>Earlier, Gossan had been wishing for further evidence to further support Hal’s claims, just so they could trust their outlandish story fully. They had been expecting to test them on their possible capability to predict some future events which, perhaps, would not have been altered by what was bound to be a massive change in everyone’s behavior compared to what they would have allegedly lived through the first time around – something which, alas, they knew would not have been so easy to find.</p>
<p>Well… Luckily for the hatchling, what was currently unfolding was just what Gossan needed to be fully convinced. For all they knew, these two had not been in contact even a single time for multiple weeks, not without Hornfels necessarily knowing about it; this was more than sixty days, and yet both could testify of the same events?</p>
<p>Somehow, though, Hornfels did not seem ready to believe this at all.</p>

<wip></wip>
<p class=radio>“I don’t know, I think it felt like… like being burned alive? And then, next thing I know, I’m back here.”</p>
<p>Hornfels squinted. “‘Here’ being…?”</p>
<p class=radio>“My camp on Giant’s Deep.”</p>
<p class=wip>(Gabbro later explains how, from what they remember: GD getting too dark, then problem with the TH comms sharing a weird sound and then not responding, then themself dying suddenly.)</p>
<p>“I— I know it sounds crazy, and I don’t even know <i>what</i> happened,” Hal blabbered nervously. “But one minute we were right here talking to them while Firn and Riebeck were studying the Nomai ruins Gabbro just talked about, and the next… I think for one second everything got <i>really</i> hot. But it was over the next second and I was right back outside the museum, <i>somehow</i>. I— I don’t remember walking out of there, how was that possible?”</p>




<wip>Soon after, with Gossan no longer distracted, they try to explain the situation. Hornfels is not at all convinced about the time travel hypothesis and thinks Gossan is too gullible.</wip>
<p>“Firn was more focused on joining Marl in making fun of me than on asking Hal <i>why</i> they were so upset.” “If this were their doing, don’t you think they would draw our attention to them instead?”</p>
<p>“Come now, Gossan, you know Firn’s specialty is misdirection. The same way they stole some kind of note of yours right before leaving,” they added with eyes raised upwards, a tiny disapproving shake of their head… and the tiniest amused smile.</p>
<p>“My—” Gossan pat themself, searched through the pouches on both sides of their belt, then threw their arms down and their head to the ceiling with an exasperated grunt. “<i>Firn!</i>”</p>
<p>“Knowing them, they must’ve hid it somewhere downstairs on their way out,” Hornfels sighed. “Hopefully not inside the anglerfish’s tank.”</p>
<p>“N-not the anglerfish, th-they wouldn’t do something that mean…” Hal mumbled shyly.</p>
<p>“They haven’t <i>yet</i>,” Hornfels insisted with an eye roll.</p>
<p class=wip>[]</p>
<p>“Hornfels, listen. Firn aside, do you really think– just <i>look</i> at Hal,” the coach sighed, gesturing an open palm towards the hatchling in question for emphasis, “does this read as a joke to you?”</p>
<p class=wip>[Hornfels is clearly conflicted, shaking their head in denial, eyes wandering to their enlarged picture of their first photo taken with their largest telescope — remembering how small and insignificant the sheer size of the universe had made them feel. How mesmerizing, yet terrifying, space and the universe as a whole appeared. (How they noticed and pondered about the fact that those galaxies seemed to get further and further away from each other at such rapid speed that, soon, they would not even be able to observe them anymore.)]</p>
<p>“I… I am not calling them a liar, of course not, but— This is absurd, they <i>have</i> to have been tricked somehow. After all– What else are you suggesting, Gossan? That <i>time travel</i> is real? That the <i>entire universe</i> went back in time and that for some reason, they and Gabbro are the only ones who noticed?”</p>
<p>“I do realize how crazy this sounds,” Gossan assured, heaving a pained sigh through their clenched teeth, “but…”</p>
<p>Hornfels crossed their arms, squinting at Hal with a mixture of conflicting emotions. “Even if it were true, why would <i>they</i> be aware of it and not us?”</p>
<p>“…The statues,” Gabbro said. “Hornfels, remember your request from earlier this morning? How you asked me to look for another Nomai statue? Well, I’d <i>found</i> one. And it opened its eyes at me.”</p>
<p>Gossan’s eyes widened. “And Hal– Didn’t you say that the statue downstairs looked at you, too? Or at least, its eyes are open <i>now</i>.”</p>
<p>Hornfels gaped in shock. “What– Are you serious? Why didn’t you say so earlier!?”</p>
<p>Turning their eyes to Hal, Gossan wordlessly asked them the same thing; but the moment they fell on their distraught face, their expression melted into compassionate concern instead, assuming that the poor hatchling must have been having far too many thoughts and emotions to deal with. As they turned back to the other founder, they frowned gravely with a stern nod. “Come downstairs. You need to see it.”</p>
<p class=wip>(At first, Hornfels is excited to see the statue’s eyes opened)</p>
<p>“This is incredible— Did either of you see it happen?”</p>
<p>Hal scratched their arm nervously. “Well… <i>I</i> did, just… <i>Before</i> time went back, you know? Th-that’s what we were trying to tell you.”</p>
<p class=wip>[Hornfels suddenly shifts gears, freezing in place.] With a twitch of their hand, then of their entire body, they gave a single step back. Their eyes were still on the statue; but all sparks of wonder had been twisted and swallowed into some kind of endless abyss.</p>
<p>“So?” Gossan asked rhetorically. “I take it this helps convince you that <i>something else</i> is going on?”</p>
<p class=wip>[Hornfels is shaking their head nervously and biting the end of their thumb, eyebrows twitching.]</p>
<p>“This isn’t… This can’t…”</p>
<p class=wip>“Forgive me.” (Hornfels ends up stepping away and leaning against a wall inside the museum, hands brought together under their nose, as they breathe loudly and stare at (either the ground or a specific exhibit? The deep space satellite exhibit?))</p>
<p class=wip>[]</p>
<p>“I don’t understand. I can’t— Why would the Nomai…? How could we all <i>forget</i>— I can’t just <i>accept this</i>.” (They grabbed their head with both hands.) “I’d been trying to get its eyes to open for <i>weeks</i>, Gossan— What if I’d… What if I’d succeeded? Would <i>I</i> have caused…? No, it can’t…”</p>
<p>“Hey. Horns. Sit down. And <i>breathe</i>.”</p>
<p class=wip>(Gossan comes back to Hal, sighing:)</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Hal. They trust you, and I’m pretty sure they’re convinced by now, but… It might take them a while before they’ll actually admit it.” “I can only imagine how stressful this has been for you, but… That whole thing’s quite scary for us too, you know? And Hornfels, they’re, uh… taking it pretty hard.”</p>
<p>Hal looked down, lips trembling. “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>The elder grabbed their shoulder tightly, giving it a small but stern shake. “Hal, correct me if there’s something else you didn’t tell us, but if not, then <i>none of this is your fault</i>. Okay? You did the right thing by letting us know. The way Hornfels takes it is not your responsibility. They’re an adult, they’re strong, they’ll get over it. Just give it some time.”</p>
<p class=wip>[So this time around, Hal and Gossan actually go to be ground control without Hornfels? Gossan tries to offer both them and Hal to follow Firn’s exploration as a way to take their minds off things for a little while, but Hornfels refuses, saying they want to study the statue to see if they could find a detail of interest which would explain… at least <i>something</i> about what happened.]</p>
<p>“Come on, Hal. Didn’t Firn say you were both excited to get your translator on the Attlerock?” (They suddenly pause.) “Uh. It… It <i>is</i> their first time on the Attlerock, right…? You said that last time they went to Giant’s Deep instead?”</p>
<p>“Yeah… Yeah. They didn’t go to the Attlerock last time. They… they’d seen it happen when the statue stared at me, so they wanted to find out why it did. That’s why they’d changed their flight schedule at the last minute.”</p>
<p class=wip>(Gossan is saddened.) “I’m sure they would’ve done it this time too if they’d been around to see what that did to you earlier.” And if they hadn’t arrived just in time to join Marl in their endless and obnoxious teasing, likely ending up too distracted themself to even notice the state Hal was in.</p>
<p class=wip>Their tone made it obvious that Gossan’s opinion was rather that Firn would have been far more interested in having both a mystery to solve and the perfect excuse to ditch the expected schedule, than in actually helping a friend; but Hal still tried to appreciate at least the thought.</p>



















<wip>(When Gossan goes to the observatory to find Hornfels, they ask if Hornfels already saw Hal today; to which Hornfels says no, of course not:</wip>
<p>“Why would I have asked you to go fetch them for me if I had already seen them today? I didn’t expect them to be awake yet at this hour, for that matter, you know they and Firn are late risers.”</p>
<wip>Hal again wonders why Hornfels was downstairs to greet them in the statue room during the first loop; if they say that this is what they remembered, Hornfels will deny it, and Gossan will say that this was practically the opposite of what they had asked Hornfels to do, as Gossan wanted Hornfels to stay at their post in ground control and monitor Firn.</wip>






<!-- WIP

<p>“The Orbital Probe Cannon was also looking for an ‘Eye of the Universe’…”</p>
<p>“The orbital what?”</p>
<p>“That’s the name of the– the ruins orbiting Giant’s Deep. You don’t…?”</p>
<p>“How would you know that? Is that just a name you and Riebeck came up with to refer to it?”</p>

<p>“N… never mind. Forget it.”</p>

<!-- WIP
Firn notices only at the end of their Attlerock exploration that something is wrong with their ship log, because they are discovering something new.
In Loops 2—5, Firn dismisses Hal because they assume Hal is worried about them crashing or getting injured, going “Hey, even if I break a thing or two, that’ll make some good souvenirs. I’ll bring you back some cool rocks! Maybe even moon bark to whittle, we’ll see if that makes a difference.”
-->

<hr style=margin-top:500px>
<p>An exploration of the Attlerock, all wrapped up! With the translator, it was almost a shame just how trivialized the whole thing had become: from North to South pole, with a chill talk with Esker and a few golden mallows to boot, the Attlerock was pretty much entirely done and over with — in barely more than a full sunrise, no less!</p>
<wip>(They sit at their computer, ready to put their ship log entries in order and organize the fancy corkboard-like diagram. But then, they find out about the ship log.)</wip>
<p>“Hal. When you told me about your– your ‘dream.’ How’d you call those ruins again?”</p>
<p class=radio>“Uh– what ruins? You mean the ‘Orbital Probe Cannon’? Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>Firn could hardly hear their last question over the sound of their own finger pummeling on the wood to the side of their keyboard. Their eyes were now fully focused on one specific action which their computer’s terminal had saved into its log history:</p>

<div class=chp id=ch4_2><h1>Chapter 4²</h1><h2>A Letter From Tomorrow</h2><hr>

<p><span class=radio>“Okay, uh. Hornfels? Call me crazy but… How do I put this.”</span> Their voice crackled through the receiver, both due to the reception and their evident unease. <span class=radio>“I went back to my ship to put my notes in order, but then I— I saw that… There were <i>other</i> notes? Written by me? That I don’t remember writing? They talk about some Nomai statues on Giant’s Deep, and a note says that the one in the museum opened its eyes, and did something to…”</span></p>
<wip></wip>
<p>“Hal. I can’t believe I’m asking, but— It’s. This is my launch day, right? This is my <i>first time in space</i>, right?”</p>
<wip></wip>
<p>From a different receiver, everyone could practically hear the eyebrow Gabbro had just raised. “Huh, would you look at that. Third person who remembers something that didn’t happen. …sort of.”</p>
<wip>Hornfels demands Firn go back to TH to get this issue checked, and though Firn is disappointed to be back home so soon, they completely agree and want to see this mystery solved.</wip>

<wip>When Firn gets their ship back on TH, their landing is not by any means what one could call graceful. Slate cringed at the particular sounds of multiple specific pieces of finely manufactured equipment being mercilessly crushed under the weight of an improperly balanced spaceship. Hornfels, Slate and Hal enter the ship to look at the ship log and verify that, indeed, there are entries describing what Hal and Gabbro remembered.</wip>



<wip></wip>

<p>“That’s not all,” Firn announced with a gulp. “Look at the <i>timestamps</i>.”</p>
<p>“…They’re… from the <i>future?</i> That can’t be,” Hornfels wheezed breathlessly.</p>
<p>“It d-did take them a few sunrises to investigate,” Hal blabbered.</p>
<p>“All ships rely on the Deep Space Satellite to calculate universal time. Is this computer broken, or— N-no, it looks perfectly fine…”</p>
<wip>Slate accuses Firn of having messed with their ship log for the sake of a prank.</wip>
<p>“I knew I shouldn’t have let you add that fancy code of yours,” Slate growled. “I <i>knew</i> you’d take the chance to turn it into yet another of your—”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t me, I swear!” Firn shrieked. “I can— Look, I know I’ve done a lot of things, but– This time, I swear I have no idea what’s going on!”</p>
<wip></wip>
<p>“J-just—” Firn took a short moment to catch their breath, trying to let their panic subside. Then… “Everyone, just… Just <i>look</i> at those photos. Has anyone ever got photos that clear of this satellite before, from <i>that</i> up close? Is it even…” “…Just hear me out. <i>Even</i> if the text entries were made up, and just me pulling your leg– How do you <i>explain</i> those photos? Think I managed to rope the other travelers into it?”</p>
<wip>At some point, Slate squints at the “Mark on HUD” option.</wip>
<p>“Wait a minute…”</p>
<wip>Slate marks the OPC’s location on the HUD, and when they look at the marker from inside the visor, they realize that the marker is aligned with Giant’s Deep— perhaps even, aligned with something slightly misaligned with it.</wip>
<p>“I can’t believe this,” they sputtered in shock. “The location tracker is only capable of pinpointing locations this ship’s already <i>been</i> to. <i>This ship</i> thinks it’s already landed on Giant’s Deep.” “Hatchling, if you messed with my autopilot—”</p>
<p>“I didn’t!” “Slate, you <i>have</i> to believe me!”</p>
<wip></wip>
<p>Also, ridiculous argument maybe, but bear with me for a second: I’ve been looking forward to getting off this rock for <i>years</i>! Why would I pull a prank that <i>obviously</i> would get me straight back to Timber Hearth to get my equipment checked?</p>
Hornfels:
<p>…I hate to admit it, but they’ve got a good point there.</p>

<!-- WIP
Firn thinks that Slate and Hornfels are the ones who pranked them in return, though they are also extremely confused. "Slate can't code this well." The reason why they are willing to let go the prank explanation is because of Hal's earlier behavior, and Gabbro's remarks about them also noticing that time went back. (Because there is no way <i>Gabbro</i> would take part in a prank, especially not from outer space)
-->

<wip>Firn tells Slate and Hornfels that they couldn’t possibly have added those extra entries:</wip>
<p>“Slate, you were <i>there</i> when we recorded those test entries to check that the ship log’s speech-to-text and remote transmission worked. You were there when we deleted all those test files – when we <i>wiped the whole thing clean</i>. <i>You were there</i> when I left the ship to you, with the suit and helmet and everything in it — you <i>know</i> the ship log was empty back then, and you <i>know</i> I didn’t have access to any means to fill it since then! Especially not after Hornfels reset the launch codes– <i>specifically</i> so I wouldn’t be able to get to the ship early!”</p>
<p>Hornfels turned to Slate, frowning: “Do you agree with all this?”</p>
<p>Slate was gritting their teeth, clearly hesitating and frustrated because of it. “Tell you what, as insane as this is… They’re right. It’s <i>impossible</i> for them to have touched the ship since I made the last checkups.” “I still need to take a thorough look at all this, though. No offense, it’s not that I don’t believe you, but…”</p>
<p>Hornfels was biting their right thumb’s nail. “I’m sorry, I cannot. There <i>has</i> to be a rational explanation to all this… I need to look at what kind of information was recorded.” “Apologies, Firn. It’s not against you personally, but regardless of your involvement, this requires investigating… without your interference.”</p>
<p>“You’ll get your ship back,” Slate assured lightly. “Just give it a couple sunrises. Maybe up till tomorrow at the latest.”</p>
<wip>Starting from the moment when Firn is chastised off their ship, they and Hal walk out of the village on a trek to talk about Hal’s experience in peace. The place they go to ends up being one from which they can witness the supernova…? (But then how can you make it so that Hal’s experience with it on Loop 6 feels fresh?). Location idea: Northern geyser mountains? How far from the village are they?</wip>

<wip>LOOP 2: When Slate and Hornfels get to see the ship log, Slate also sees that there is a marker for multiple locations: Gabbro’s Island, Statue Island, and the OPC’s Launch Module. They will ask Gossan to pilot the ship and follow those markers to make sure that they’re accurate — so even though Gossan believes Hal and Firn (thanks to Hal), they can’t stay with the two and they can’t give Firn the ship back.</wip>


<wip>Firn ends up grounded and stuck with Hal, as they try to figure out what happened? Hal apologizes about not having been able to help convincing Slate, but Firn sighs and admits that it’s a grave they may have dug for themself there, and that Hal likely wouldn’t have been able to do much.</wip>
<p>“They would’ve just accused you of trying to cover me,” Firn sighed. “It’s just… <i class=grey>Ugh.</i> Worst part is, that’s <i>totally</i> something I would do. Just, you know, not on <i>my</i> first launch.” “I’m sure that would’ve been enough to convince them if it had been anyone else’s ship, but… Yeah. Too bad I got to work on the <i>one</i> part of the ship that <i>just so happened</i> to malfunction, eh?”</p>
<p>“I thought the photos were pretty convincing,” Hal shrugged heavily.</p>
<p>“They’re just the interior of Nomai structures. I bet Hornfels just thought those could’ve been some of Riebeck’s photos of the Hanging City for all we know. And the ones about that beach on Giant’s Deep… Well, even if Gabbro doesn’t work much, I bet even they must’ve shared a bunch when they came back with your statue.”</p>
<!-- Actually, Firn forgot to take even a single photo of the OPC aside from their failed attempt from inside the projection pool. Too bad :P -->
<wip></wip>
<p>“So… What do you think that whole thing was even about?” Hal pondered uneasily. “What even <i>happened?</i>”</p>
<p>“You tell me,” Firn sighed with a humorless laugh, “I’m not the one who got to remember anything about our first time around.”</p>
<p>“But I don’t even know where to get started!” they cried, throwing their hands in the air. “<i>Everything</i> was normal. You, Gabbro, and Riebeck, you were all standing in that Orbital Probe Cannon— You got to figure out its <i>name</i>, you got to figure out that it was meant to search for something called the <i>Eye of the Universe</i>, and… It just, ended. Everything got hot for a second, and the next, I was standing near the zero-g cave with Gossan and Marl thinking I’d had a stroke.”</p>
<p>A pause. Then: “The ‘everything got hot’ part. Any idea—”</p>
<p>“I didn’t get to see anything, Firn. I have no clue what that was. I barely even had time to realize that something was wrong that– it was already over. It hurt a <i>lot</i>, but… only for a second.”</p>
<p>A pause. Hal brought their legs close to their chest and surrounded them with their arms. Eyes floating away into the void, they started shuddering.</p>
<wip>Hal, by trying to remember what happened in that moment, gets trapped in a loop of their brain making them relive over and over the few seconds of burning alive, and they grit their teeth, groaning in pain. Firn realizes that their shuddering is way too vivid, and they seize their shoulders, asking if they’re okay, as they manage to snap Hal out of it. Eyes wide and pupils far too small, panting with panic, Hal slowly calms down, feeling the</wip>
<p>“S-sorry, I…”</p>
<p>“Hal, <i>no apologizing</i>. What in Dark Bramble got you <i>that</i> worked up?”</p>
<p>They shuddered again. “E-ever since I… Ever since that statue looked at me. My memories… There’s been something <i>wrong</i> with my memories. They’re way too real. It’s like I—”</p>
<p>Firn squinted. “Gonna put my mallows on that having to do with you and Gabbro being the only ones who got to remember. Let me guess, they too have their memories acting weird like that?”</p>
<p>“They didn’t say, but…” Hal shuddered, closing their eyes tightly shut and taking a sharp inhale. The phantom pain, when would they ever get <i>rid</i> of it?</p>
<p>Firn tried to give their shoulder a gentle squeeze, but when their friend seethed through their teeth in response, they immediately took their hand away. “So like– <i>right now</i>, you’re– Geez.”</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>“Earlier this time around,” Hal gulped. “Gabbro asked Hornfels if they’d died.”  “…Do you think I died, Firn? I-it hurt <i>so</i> much, and then it just… didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you, uh, try to think of a <i>different</i> memory, maybe? You think that would help? Find a funny one. What about that one time, you know— the ?”</p>
<wip>Hal stifles a short laugh; but then, they realize that the memory does not become overly vivid, and instead remains as just an afterthought. They frown.</wip>
<p>“That’s weird. Or, uh… I guess that’s <i>not</i> weird, but like— That was just normal remembering. Not… feeling like I was back there all over again.”</p>
<wip>They realize that the only memories that get Hal stuck living two events at once are those starting from the moment when they met Gossan, and that all memories prior to that are unaffected. Firn wants to take a look at the statue, but Hal isn’t too enthusiastic.</wip>
<p>Hal blinked and looked up at them in worry. Then, a sad corner of their mouth was twisted upright, more out of nervous angst than anything else. “…Right. You don’t… You don’t remember when we were…”</p>



<wip>Loop 2 end: Firn and Hal have walked far enough from the crater to see the supernova early, but they don’t get to see the sun crumple in on itself?</wip>

<p>“Uh. Is it just me, or does the sun look… bigger than usual?”</p>
<p>“…Huh, you’re… you’re right. Is that some kind of optical illusion, or…?”</p>
<p>Firn squinted and pursed their lips, deep in thought, considering multiple hypotheses. But then… Slowly, frigid horror dawned upon their face.</p>
<p>“Hal. When you– ‘died.’ Or when it ended, whatever. What’d you say it felt like?”</p>
<p>“Burning? I think? But also, way hotter than you’d imagine from a campfire, so, I’m not completely sure?”</p>
<p>Firn gulped, eyes locked on to the sky. “Did you ask Gabbro how they died too?”</p>
<p>“Uh– not really. Same thing, I assume?”</p>
<p>Hal looked at the sun, then at their best friend, then at the sun and then their friend again, finally settling on the latter. “You’re not serious.”</p>
<p>“<i>You</i> tell me I’m guessing wrong.” Firn raised both hands to hold their upper arms, trying to masquerade the gesture as simply crossing their arms but failing to hide just how tightly they were holding on.</p>
<p>“It’s– N-no, that can’t— Did we <i>all</i> die last time!? I-is it about to happen again– It <i>can’t</i> happen again! W-w-what if this time it’s permanent!?”</p>
<p>“What if it <i>isn’t</i> permanent…?” Firn mumbled under their breath, otherwise petrified and incapable of doing anything else.</p>

<wip>(Eventually they see the sun start to collapse, but Hal at least doesn’t want to look. They either bury their head inside Firn’s chest and cry, or try to run back to the village, even knowing that it wouldn’t accomplish anything.)</wip>

- If Firn skips the zero-g training, they find Hornfels for the launch codes at 06d04s.02:04 (17min after waking up). If Gossan gets Firn to repair the mining equipment, then Firn makes it to the museum at 06d04s.17:25 instead (32min after waking up).

- Loops 3-5: Hal tries to radio Firn in order to ask them to check their ship log first, but they don’t know how and Hornfels doesn’t take them seriously?
- Loop 4, Hal tries to tell both Hornfels and Firn about the time loop at the same time, as they arrive, but neither believes them. Hal gives up soon, deflated and unwilling to have things devolve into an argument.

- At some point after getting confirmation that the ship log works, Firn will change the setting so that the ship log screen will flash and show the TL;DR (so the in-game ship log) first thing they do, making it impossible for them to not notice provided they use their ship. This would be at a point when Firn is convinced that there is an infinite time loop, so it isn’t this early.

<div class=chp id=ch1_3><h1>Chapter 1³</h1><h2>XXXXXXXXXXXXX</h2><hr>

<wip></wip>
<p>“<i>Finally</i>,” they heard the founder exhale, eyes briefly rising to the stars. The three eyes lowered instantly to stare back, and the next words they heard were clearly destined to them: “Oi, hatchling. You good?”</p>
<p>Hal stared, mouth agape. By the time they could almost find their words, a hand was placed on their shoulder, and the voice of Marl resonated behind their back, eerily familiar.</p>
<p>“Welcome back to the living,” they heard with a mixture immense relief in their voice.</p>
<p>Looking at one Hearthian then the other in turn, Hal took a step back away from both, staggering. “It– <i>again?</i>” they blabbered.</p>
<p>Gossan frowned, carefully closing the space between them all the while trying not to intrude. “What do you mean, ‘again’?”</p>
<p>They blinked repeatedly as they turned around, taking in their surroundings. Patch of ghost matter, Marl behind them, zero-g cave right by them, Gossan having once again been holding their chin. The bottom of their eyelids twitching nervously, they turned again to Gossan and repeated, with more assurance: “It happened again.”</p>
<p>Marl’s voice came in from behind. “What, you’ve already had those freaky ‘I’m a statue’ episodes before?”</p>
<p>“N-no— …Yes? B-but I mean—” Hal retreated further until their back hit the rocky wall of the mines. “<i>This</i>. This scene. We’ve had this happen before.”</p>
<p>Marl and Gossan exchanged confused and worried glances. Marl found their voice first: “Hal, what are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“You don’t… remember?” Hal shook their head. “That was barely three sunrises ago…”</p>
<p>Then it came flooding back, everything sounding painfully obvious in hindsight. The lack of recollection from Hornfels and Firn too. The clock having been all weird. Firn’s <i>ship log</i> having data from the future…</p>
<p>Hal’s fingers dug into the stone, feeling like the Hearthians in front of them were some kinds of corporeal ghosts.</p>
<p>They needed to tell Gabbro. <i>Gabbro</i> had not forgotten anything last time it happened.</p>
<p>Gossan caught their arm, worry and panic flooding their face. “Whoa there, where are you going? Hal, given what just happened and how pale you still are, you should go see Porphy and make sure you didn’t catch something nasty.”</p>
<p>“I-<span class=scaps>i</span>’m fine!” they cried out much louder than they had intended to. “P-please let me go!”</p>
<p>Gossan’s eyes widened when they realized just how terrified Hal looked; when they realized what they were so terrified of.</p>
<p>Considering the unsettling experience they had just gone through, regardless of whether they were maintained fully asleep in some kind of trance, or they were aware and unable to move no matter how much they may have tried — it was only natural that they would feel disoriented and terrified.</p>
<p>What was not at all natural, however, would surely have to be the object of their fear. Had Gossan gone through such experience, no doubt they would have been scared of many things: of losing control of their own limbs, of falling off the cliff if they were to lose consciousness like this again at a different moment when nobody else would be there to catch them, of getting stuck in such eerie state and never being able to wake up again… And yet, somehow, it appeared that none of the fear radiating off Hal’s face was directed at any of these uncertain unknowns.</p>
<p>No. Far on the contrary, their fear had found a fully tangible, real, present destination:</p>
<p>For some unfathomable reason, the young Hearthian was terrified of <i>them</i>.</p>
<p>At a loss for what to do, Gossan released their grip and took a gentle step back. Hal shakingly retracted their newly freed arm and took it to their chest, clutching it with their other hand. Their glassy gaze was staring right back, and although none of the terror had left, Gossan hoped that the glimmer of gratitude they thought they could see was more than just a figment of their imagination.</p>
<p>“I h-have to– the observatory,” the hatchling mumbled as they trembled. “<i>Please</i>.”</p>
<p>The coach and lumberjack exchanged a concerned glance. Mercifully, Gossan turned back to them and slowly nodded. “If you insist. But let me accompany you.” There was a tense pause, as their lips pondered some more words. Eventually, they felt the need to specify: “…From a distance, if you prefer.”</p>
<p class=vs>Hal’s ears flickered and flattened, but they pressed their lips together, gulped, and shakingly returned the nod.</p>
<p>Better than nothing.</p>

<wip></wip>

<p>Gossan gave a heavy sigh, trying not to be intrusive, but clearly wanting to be involved. “Is there any way you could explain what any of this was about?”</p>
<p>Hal’s arms tightened around their chest; but, reluctantly, they nodded. “We’ve… I tried to say it. This– this whole thing with you and Marl. It already happened. I was on my way to the observatory— but I’ve already <i>been there</i> today. <i>Twice</i>.”</p>
<p>Gossan’s good eyes squinted, though they did not dare interrupt.</p>
<p>“Something happened,” the hatchling continued. “Or… is <i>going</i> to happen? I’m not quite sure either. It’s like… time itself has been acting all weird and wrong this morning. And like I’m the only one on this planet who noticed.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Hal repressed a sob. “You– don’t believe me, do you.”</p>
<p>Gossan did not respond. When Hal glanced at them, the coach was avoiding their gaze.</p>
<p>“I-it’s okay,” they assured with a broken laugh, “I know it sounds crazy. I wouldn’t believe myself either.”</p>
<p>More silence, though it did not last nearly as long. The tone was almost too low for Hal to make out the words, but they were pretty sure they heard the founder mumble to themself that <i>“If Firn roped you in another of their jokes, you’re really taking this one way too far.”</i></p>
<p class=vs>Hal’s fists clenched and shook. Firn’s <i>pranks</i> were often at the expense of others, and they, but even they would never stoop that low— and Hal was not <i>this</i> easy to manipulate and trick into involuntarily pulling on an act this serious, for this long.</p>
<p>If <i>Firn</i> had been the one to come to them and tell them the story of time breaking down and everyone forgetting about it, Gossan's doubts would have been more than justified, and Hal themself would not have believed a single word of it, because nice and suggestible as they were, they were not <i>stupid</i>. But, in their defense: contrary to them, Firn had a <i>history</i> as a crafty, resourceful, and creative prankster. If Hal had any history, it was a history of <i>being</i> pranked.</p>
<p class=vs>Besides, everyone knew that Hal had rarely ever been a voluntary ‘actor’ during those pranks, and that they were rather just gaslit and being played like a fiddle until they realized they had been partaking in the setup from the very beginning. Hal’s good acting skills only stemmed from their own lack of confidence and its resulting gullibility.</p>
<p>This time, however, was different. Unless Firn had somehow figured out how to magically bend time itself, that was, and unless on top of this they had completely shed any sense of compassion for their friends and caretakers. For these two reasons alone, on top of a mountain of others, Hal knew that this was simply <i>impossible</i>.</p>
<p>The fact that Gossan would even <i>dare</i> think of the possibility… It hurt. It hurt in so many ways.</p>
<p>“I promise Firn has nothing to do with this. Last time, they didn’t remember anything either, and they–” Pause. A pained gulp. “…They didn’t believe me either when I tried to tell them.” Inhaling sharply through their nose, they turned around all at once and gave an accusing look. “Gossan, how do you even <i>expect</i> Firn to somehow be able to wipe other people’s memories!? If anyone’s being pranked here, it’s me! By all of you!”</p>
<p>The two exchanged a long glare. Truth and trust, in silence and mutual respect, clashed like blades in the starlight. Gossan’s determination, to their own shock, was the first to waver.</p>
<p>With a lost sigh, they relented and asked: “What are you hoping to find in the observatory?”</p>
<p>Hal gulped. “Gabbro,” they responded. “Through the, um. Through the radio, of course.” They looked down, trembling. “…Hopefully.”</p>
<p>Gossan tilted their head, having heard pretty much the <i>last</i> thing they would have put on their list of guesses. “Why them?”</p>
<p>Hal’s lips twisted into a small, pained smirk, sighing darkly. “Because if <i>I’m</i> the one partaking in the joke, then they’re the one I’m teaming up with this time.”</p>

<wip></wip>

<p>As the two approached the entrance to the museum and faced the misplaced Nomai statue, Gossan had a double take. “It wasn’t like that the last time I was here,” they heaved. “And I was—”</p>
<p>“It was like that the last time <i>I</i> was here,” Hal simply retorted, voice weak and tired, but unwavering. Their grip on their forearms tightened as they passed by, but their pace had remained uninterrupted all the while, and their eyes had hardly moved to even look at it.</p>



<!-- .


<p>This was when it finally clicked.</p>
<p>Hal seized both of Firn’s shoulders in their grip, forcing all of their eyes to meet. They both stared at each other intently, one with worry and extreme confusion, the other with distress; but Hal’s mouth, though barely open, found itself numb and unable to speak.</p>
<p>“Hal, are you… alright? What’s going on?”</p>
<p>Hal wished they could answer. They so dearly wished they could answer and not fear countless unfortunate outcomes in the same moment.</p>



Loop 3+:
Hornfels: “Since when are you invested in getting any kind of work done?”
Gabbro: “Even broken clocks are right twice a day,” somehow managing the exact same audible shrug as the last loop.
“That and I don’t think the time loop is really giving them much of a choice,” Hal sighed.

Gabbro advises Hal not to tell Hornfels about the time loop.
“We’re gonna have to tell them anyway when your buddy sees their ship log,” they sighed. “Trying to explain it once every few hours is already going to be a pain, imagine having to explain it <i>twice</i> per loop.”
By Loop 3, Gabbro recommends Hal to not tell Hornfels about the time loop until Firn finds out; which contributes to Hal feeling like they can’t even be honest until halfway through the loop.
-->

<wip></wip>
<p>Hal’s lower left eye twitched. They had heard that before, and this felt wrong. This was just… completely <i>wrong.</i></p>
<p>Firn had always been known for two things: for one, they were sarcastic; but most importantly, they were <i>unpredictable</i>. (resourceful?)</p>
<p>What they had just heard this time had not been just the same words—they had used the exact same tone of voice, the exact same gestures, with the exact same timing right down to a fraction of a millisecond.</p>
<p>It made sense, Hal knew it, and they knew that they should have anticipated it; but it was still <i>wrong</i>.</p>
<p>While too dumbfounded to openly react, their ears picked up on the sound of Hornfels giving, they too, the exact same words and actions that they had displayed less than four hours prior. Hal glanced from the corner of their top right eye, and just as they should have known, Hornfels found the launch codes on the exact same note as the last two times, in the exact same state and location as before.</p>
<p>The fact that, in this room, only they seemed to have any idea that anything at all was so <i>wrong</i>, made them nauseous. Surely Gabbro would have given a reaction if they had been standing in this room, and not kilometers away on another planet, right? Surely they could not be the only one seeing this scene unfold under their eyes and feel like they were trapped with ghosts of the past…</p>
<p>But also, even if they had been standing in this room, how could they ever expect a reaction of any kind from <i>Gabbro?</i> They had seen the sun itself <i>explode</i>, according to their account — <i>twice</i>, even — and yet they had been… so relaxed about it all, as they always were. Out of all emotions they could have possibly expressed, were they confused and lost by the logical intricacies of the predicament they were in? Of course. After all, strange as they were, they still had <i>some</i> common sense.</p>
<p>But now, shocked, distraught, horrified? Hal hoped that the only reason they could not detect any of it was because they could not see the Hearthian face to face.</p>




<wip>Firn tells Hornfels they want to go to the Attlerock.</wip>
<p>Hal took a quick and nervous step forward, blurting out, “What about– uh, Brittle Hollow? The south pole maybe?”</p>
<p>Firn gave them a confused look. Briefly turning to Hornfels, they asked: “Isn’t Riebeck already there?”</p>
<p>“Just like Esker is already on the Attlerock, yes,” Hal interrupted again with just a little more insistence, “so what?”</p>
<p>Again, silence. “I thought you <i>wanted</i> to see what the rest of the southern ruins were talking about?”</p>
<p>“I… changed my mind?”</p>
<p>The radio crackled, giving a sigh from hundreds of kilometers away. “Just let them go, buddy. They’ll find out soon enough.”</p>



<wip>Loop 3: Hal tries to convince Firn to visit something other than the Attlerock, and when they’re not convinced, Hal mentions the statue; but then, instead, Hornfels walks down the stairs and forgets the comms, therefore leaving Firn to visit the Attlerock. It is Gossan who shows up at some point, because Firn had tried to radio Hornfels, and when Hornfels did not respond, they tried to radio Gossan instead.</wip>
<p>“Firn, listen, the statue’s eyes opened, and–”</p>
<p>If a Nomai statue’s eyes had opened, Hornfels’ widened ten times more. “Its eyes—! Hal, why didn’t you say so earlier!?”</p>
<p>Before Hal could even attempt to answer that question, the curator had already disappeared to the floor below, completely abandonning the ground control post.</p>
<p>“Wait, no– <i>Hornfels!</i> Hornfels, come back!”</p>
<p>Firn placed a comforting hand around their shoulder (which did nothing except for send a shiver down their spine), laughing softly. “Relax. I don’t need to be kept on a leash to still be safe in space. I can totally take off without them.”</p>
<p>Hal was trembling too much to find in them the capability to reply that, surprisingly enough, Firn’s flight capabilities were currently the least of their worries.</p>
<p>(Firn and Hal go down the stairs after them. They exchange a few words, then Firn is ready to leave. Hal tries to stop them, but Hornfels catches their arm in excitement, asking them to tell them everything about what they saw with that statue.)</p>
<p>“Have fun, you two!” Firn snickered before they turned around and waved them goodbye without looking, stepping out of the museum with an entusiasm loud enough to drown out the sound of Hal’s desperate attempts at calling after them.</p>



<wip>Much later, Gossan arrives and glares at Hornfels for not being at their job.</wip>
<p>“Hornfels, I hate to disrupt your fascinating research, but may I ask what you are doing <i>away from the comms</i> on Firn’s first launch?”</p>
<p>“Gossan? What brings you here?”</p>
<p>Gossan tapped at the radio on their belt. “Firn tried to contact ground control. When they couldn’t get to you, they tried getting to me instead.” “Hornfels, again– What are you doing here instead of upstairs, making sure they’re doing alright? You’re lucky they didn’t sound <i>injured</i> when they called me.”</p>
<p>Hornfels looked evidently displeased by the distraction, but sighed and slowly went for the stairs, mumbling to themself that Firn had better not have crashed somewhere and be asking for a rescue mission.</p>
<p>Gossan’s three eyes turned to the other Hearthian next to them, tone now softer but traits on their face just as grave as before, if not with even deeper creaks.</p>
<p>“You should come with, Hal,” they sighed tensely. “Firn said they wanted to talk to you specifically.”</p>





<wip>Loop 3/4/5 Firn realizes that something is wrong as soon as they try to write down their first discovery, because their ship log will reply with "ERROR: DUPLICATE ENTRY."</wip>
<p class=radio>“Uh… Hi, uh, Hornfels? Do you copy?”</p>
<p>The elder startled; Hal’s ears dropped.</p>
<p>“Yes, Firn, loud and clear. What is it?”</p>
<p class=radio>“I wanted to update my ship log, but I just got a weird error message. It read something like– ‘<span class=scaps>error: duplicate entry</span>’…? So I went back to my ship to check on what that was about, and…”</p>
<p>“…and everything you were about to write about was already there?” Hal guessed with a painful sigh.</p>
<p>Their response was a shocked silence. Then: “Hal, how in the <i>geysers</i> could you have guessed that?”</p>
<p>“You did say the error message was about a ‘duplicate entry’,” Gabbro came in with their signature audible shrug.</p>
<p>“W-well <i>yeah</i>, sure, but— Gabbro, it wasn’t <i>just</i> the entry I had just finished typing, it was a whole, I don’t know, probably a day’s worth of findings I’d never made! <i>Already in there!</i>” “And the entry I wanted to add was just <i>word for word</i> the exact same as the one– I just…” There came the pained sigh.</p>
<p>Hal decided it was time to drop the anvil. Again. “You already explored the Attlerock, Firn.”</p>
<p>Hornfels’ hands twitched, uncomfortably fiddling with the corners of some of their notebook’s pages in silence.</p>
<p>The radio crackled again, repressing a shocked strangled sound. “…<i>What?</i>”</p>
<p>“You just forgot,” Hal continued. “Everyone forgot except me and Gabbro.”</p>
<p>“And your ship,” Gabbro completed.</p>
<p>“It’s the third time you had your ‘first launch,’ Firn. And I don’t think… By this point you might have your fourth and fifth time or— I don’t know if time is going to repeat <i>again</i>, but it’s rewound twice already and I don’t know what we could ever do about it.”</p>
<p>After their tirade went a long, long pause. Finally, with a timid voice, the radio went again:</p>
<p>“…You’re crazy. This has to be a joke. It <i>has</i> to.”</p>
<p>“Firn, nobody could have possibly predicted what you were about to write in your ship log down to the <i>exact same words</i> like you just said yourself, and you <i>know</i> it.”</p>
<p>Silence returned.</p>
<p>“Okay. Gonna… okay. The last two times, when did time start, I don’t know, looping back? Is that what you think happened?”</p>
<p>“It ended soon before the nineth sunrise,” Hal sighed. “When the, uh. According to what you said last time, it was when the sun went supernova.”</p>
<p>“<i class=scaps>what!?</i>”</p>
<p>“Both times,” Gabbro added for emphasis. “My mallows are on it having happened the first time too. Ending felt the same.”</p>
<p>Hal turned to Hornfels, worried about their continued silence, and saw them shaking like a pine tree needle falling to the wind. Their shaken eyes betrayed the same feeling Hal had witnessed when they had obtained the first few photos with their telescope and discovered that instead of merely stars, the universe was littered with entire galaxies; the same feeling of a truth being revealed all at once, too heavy to bear, leaving them in overwhelmed awe and wishing for a chair to sit down so they could focus on catching their breath.</p>
<p>Except of course, this time, awe likely had to be replaced, or at the very least ensnared within a thick layer of raw fear and terror.</p>
<p>Firn was far too quiet. So quiet, even the static seemed to have quieted down, and Hal almost wondered if they had turned their radio off.</p>
<p>When their voice was finally heard again, their tone was filled with determination.</p>
<p>“Tell me everything.”</p>






<wip>### Loop 3:</wip>
<p>Firn frowned, biting their lips. “How many times has it been my ‘first launch’?”</p>
<p>“Three in total,” Hal sighed. “Your first one was on Giant’s Deep and then in the thing <i>orbiting</i> Giant’s Deep, and the previous one was you… also exploring the Attlerock.”</p>
<p>(Firn apologizes because Hal tried to encourage them to go elsewhere, and failed)</p>
<p>“So that’s why you said you’d changed your mind.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>“I should’ve listened. I’m sorry.”</p>





<wip>End of loop, Gabbro either gets picked up by a cyclone or Firn picked them up in their ship.</wip>
<p>“Uh… Hal?” “Brace yourself. Sun’s coming.”</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>“See you in the next one.”</p>


<hr>
<div class=shiplog><h2>Reading Entry: “so time got wacky and i forgot stuff TWICE but my ship didn’t what in the brambling geysers is going on.log”</h2>
<p class=time>06d05s 32:14</p>
<p>Alright I have no idea if this is going to work. I don’t even know if it’ll be of any use since we can’t be sure that whatever happened twice already is gonna happen a third time or more. Chances are this is just going to be a big waste of time. Still, gotta give it a try, right?</p>
<p>So, uh. Hey, future me! (???) Or Hal, if you find this and read it. Not sure if you’ll do that. Bet you must be having a lot of better things to do, or just a lot of things on your mind to worry about. I shouldn’t be burdening you with my ramblings, especially not when I’m… well, about to forget everything. Again. Probably.</p>
<p>Anyway, future me, here’s the thing. Hal and Gabbro both think that a time loop is <i>likely</i> going on, and the fact that my ship log was filled with notes <i>I</i> had somehow written FROM THE FUTURE even though it’s my first time in here is what I’d call <i>pretty solid proof</i> that they’re actually serious.</p>
<p>So yeah somehow these two have been stuck repeating this morning a few times already. Only twice, Hal says, but that’s enough for us all to make the guess that this is <i>probably</i> going to happen again. Time is going to repeat until we figure out what to do to fix it.</p>
<p>We also have a hypothesis as to why they’re the only ones who can remember the previous times. It’s just a guess, again, but that’s pretty much the only lead we have, and it sounds like the most sensical thing we can come up with for now.</p>
<p>On their first loop <span class=smol>(??? Yeah, gonna stick with ‘loop’ for now, whatever)</span>, something happened to them both. Remember the Nomai statue Hal told you about, the one Gabbro brought back from Giant’s Deep? For some reason, that statue opened its eyes and did something to Hal, like if it read their memories or something. And the same thing happened to Gabbro with another statue on Giant’s Deep.</p>
<p>And that got me thinking. This ship’s computer has been built with a chipped part of Hal’s statue in it. So maybe this is why the ship remembers too.</p>
<p>No matter what happens, IF the time loop really is a thing, then I’m going to forget everything soon. But the <i>ship</i> won’t. So yeah. Here I am, talking to myself. Hypothetically. Hoping somehow this message will make it to the next loop and future me will find it, or however that works.</p>
<p>It’d be cool if I could catch up without having to rely on Hal and Gabbro. I can only imagine how annoying that would be for them. So, yeah, fingers crossed on two things. First, that this will work. Second, that future me will have the same idea as present me and check the computer for notes.</p>
<p>Anyway that’s been a lot of rambling, and IF the time loop is real, I’ve only got so long before everything’s over. Lots of investigating to do in the meantime. Will write a summary later of what we’re gonna find out this time around.</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 43:12</p>
<p>Okay according to Hal the sun will explode before the next sunrise, so now would be a good time for me to leave notes. Future me, if this message makes it across, this is what we found out during this loop:</p><ul>
<li class=red>[Insert findings<!-- related to the Hanging City? Only Riebeck is the one doing the discoveries here, Firn doesn’t have enough time to leave the Attlerock. -->]</li>
</ul>
<p>Third loop’s me signing out, over. Good luck future me (if you ever become a thing), let’s hope this wall of text won’t get erased forever in like twenty minutes or something.</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 44:03</p>
<p>The sun is… not looking good. I’m pretty sure now that it’s not going to be permanent, but <i>still</i>. Can you imagine??</p>
<p>I don’t want to <i>die</i>. Or figure out how painful it’s going to be.</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 46:43</p>
<p>Hal says it’ll be over quick, at least.</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 46:49</p>
<p>I hope they’re not lying to make me feel better.<br>That explosion is slower than it has any right to be.</p>

<wip>Start of loop:</wip>
<p>“<i>Finally</i>,” Gossan exhaled for what was somehow simultaneously the first and third time, before once again asking: “Oi, hatchling. You good?”</p>
<p>“Welcome back to the living,” Marl soon came in, just as oblivious as the previous time.</p>

<p>Ears flattening all the way to their shoulders, Hal closed their eyes tightly shut and gritted their teeth, heaving a tired sigh. “Hi, you two. I’m <i>fine</i>. Forget it.”</p>
<wip></wip>

<!-- Do you keep this for Loop 5 instead?

In their… second loop? Yeah, probably second if they decided they would count the one in which the statue did its thing as the first one. It felt appropriate to do it like that.
Anyway– in their <i>second loop</i>, then, they had managed to get Gossan on their side rather easily enough, all things considered. Maybe they could just… say the things they had said back then, instead of just wallowing in their predicament so much that they forgot the obvious solution?
“Gossan, I– I think I’m stuck in some kind of time loop,” they muttered. Geez, it still felt wrong and utterly insane to say.
“Yeah, ha, I know that sounds crazy, but just– hear me out?” They took a deep breath. Necessary as it was for their own well-being, it still felt mean to just… drop the anvil <i>too</i> suddenly. “It’s the fourth loop. We talked a lot, in the previous ones. And, uh– Okay, don’t freak out, alright?”
“Just say it,” Gossan grumbled, evidently losing patience, and Hal buried their head inside their shoulders with a small but cold shudder.
“–Tektite told you yesterday that some mining equipment broke in the zero-g cave and you were considering the idea to use it to give Firn some last minute training,” they heaved rapidly in one single breath, eyes closed so as to avoid looking at Gossan’s face. “You also told me you hadn’t made up your mind yet by this point. A-and, uh, also, you told Hornfels to focus on getting everything ready for Firn’s first launch, and in return they actually asked you to come fetch me to tell me that the statue was ready, too. And also if we both go to the museum we’ll see that it’ll have moved on its own even though its eyes were closed when you left, and you’ll say, uh, and I quote, ‘It wasn’t like that the last time I was here, and I was here less than ten minutes ago.’ But the mining equipment thing seemed to be more convincing when I told you about it, because it’s the only one where you told me it’s literally impossible for anyone else to have told me since, uh, that one never left your mind and you weren’t even sure about it yet.”
Silence fell. After a whizzling inhale making its way inwards through their gritted teeth, Hal dared open one lower eye to peek.
Gossan’s mouth was hanging open, as now was their turn to freeze in place.
Yep, pretty much what they had expected.
Marl, eyes squinting dubiously, turned their head to one Hearthian, then the other, back and forth. “Uh. Whaaaaaat…? Gossan? Any idea what they’re on about?”
As much as they hated doing that to them, Hal did not have the strength to deal with Marl. Opening their three remaining eyes and instantly diverting them to the ground at their side, they heaved an apologetic sigh, trying to finish with Gossan first. “S-sorry, I’m not sure there’s any non-creepy way to bring it up,” they mumbled. “But, uh, I hope I at least got your attention with that –uh– ‘mind-reading’ demonstration, heh, e-even though of course I can’t <i>actually</i> read your mind or anything. I-it’s just that we’ve been through this before, and you just d-don’t… remember it. And Marl doesn’t either.”
Still keeping their silence and their semi-gaping mouth, Gossan’s head slowly bobbled up and down in a shocked nod. Then, as they were still nodding, this time with more purpose: “Alright, hatchling. You… got my attention alright.”
Hal sighed again, this time in immense relief. Marl squinted even further with a baffled <i>“Huuuuuh???”</i> Gossan, on the other hand, saw their expression melt into horror.
“Stars above… But then, now what? Have you just been <i>trapped</i> like this…? For how long? How long do we have before it’ll happen again?”
“Just about three sunrises,” Hal answered mechanically, trying to avoid thinking too hard about the other two questions.
Gossan’s eyes slid away from them as they nodded again, always with smaller amplitude and greater frequency, each time coming closer to turn their nodding into blatant trembling instead. “Marl, I think they’re actually serious about this.”
Marl was stammering, desperately trying to hang on to the last straws of doubt but being incapable of coming up with any better explanation. “Okay, either you’ve both been roped in a Firn prank, or you’ve both been conked in the head pretty hard, or–”
“Or we have actual evidence, or at least <i>some</i> evidence, that time has indeed been acting weird,” Gossan frowned, sending the lumberjack a stern look. “Marl, do you seriously believe Firn would convince <i>me</i> to take part in a scheme of theirs?”
Hal rubbed their upper arm, giving a tense and humorless chuckle. “You can also try to get Rutile, but the last times you tried it they just sort of– I’m <i>physically okay</i>, and they’re very busy, so they just never took the time to look into it or take you seriously at all. Today is sort of a crazy day for a lot of reasons, even without the time loop thing, so even if they don’t remember the loops either, they just… you know. They’re Rutile.”
Marl’s eyebrows trembled nervously, in a disjointed rhythm to that of their equally trembling lips. “This is nuts. All of this is nuts.” However, from the tone of these assertions, it sounded like they had indeed run out of arguments.
Hal’s eyes widened. A loop in which <i>Marl</i> was actually convinced as well? Finally? They hadn’t dared hope to see the day.



Loop 6 (or Loop 5?), Hal starts their loop by turning around to stare Marl down before they can reach them.
There was the sound of rushing footsteps in their back. With a sharp inhale, Hal turned around and crossed their arms “Welcome back to the living.”
Marl stopped straight in their tracks, almost slipping on a stray rock in the process, as their eyes tripled in size. “W-<i>what?</i>”
“That’s what you were about to say, right?” Hal doubled down, mouth drawing a smirk that absolutely did not belong on such a face. With a nervous breath loudly entering through their nose, they pivoted so they could look at both Hearthians at the same time; then, they added: “I’ve been stuck in a time loop. Gossan, you haven’t set your mind on it, but you’ve been considering offering Firn some last minute training in the zero-g cave ever since Tektite told you that some equipment broke down there. Is that good enough to convince you both that I’m serious?”
Gossan stumbled back, eyes widening in turn.
Marl frowned with trembling eyebrows, trying to figure out whether they should be more confused or more utterly freaked out. “Uh– A t-‘time loop’– Sorry, I just don’t– How does that even work?”
“I don’t know the details of how it works, but while I was frozen in place— I basically got memories from the previous loops– so basically a bunch of future events that never happened, I guess. That’s how I know things I shouldn’t be able to: you both <i>told me</i> those things before, you just don’t remember that you did.” “I think the reason I freeze up like that and get those memories is because the first time around, the Nomai statue in the museum opened its eyes at me and did <i>something</i>– and Gabbro’s in it too, by the way, they found another statue on Giant’s Deep and it opened its eyes at them too.” With a pause, they pinched their lips together and looked at both one by one. “Other questions?”
Gossan crossed their arms, gaze wavering between stern straight-to-business practicality and concerned horror. “Any clues on how to fix this?”
Hal’s ears dropped. “Not really.” They gulped, trying not to let their mind think too hard about it– to not let their emotions surface… “We’ve tried a few things, but we don’t even know <i>why</i> there’s a time loop, or why the statues did their thing, or why the Nomai somehow built statues that can basically send memories back in time. We’re… w-we’re sort of j-just stuck, right now…”
[Marl and Gossan exchange a horrified look. Marl is the first to slowly approach, raising a tentative arm, and Hal hesitantly but gladly takes their offer, wrapping their arms around their chest and hugging tight.] “Geez, Hal… That’s rough. That’s so rough. I mean, <i>geysers</i>, that’s… wow.”
A gloved hand went to lay on their shoulder. It wasn’t long before Gossan joined the embrace, keeping their silence.
Hal’s shoulders quivered, and a few seconds later, there was a wet sniffle. Then another. Then a third, and a fourth, each coming more rapidly than the previous one.
So much for trying to hold it together.





Hornfels: "Since when are you invested in getting any kind of work done?"
Gabbro: "Even broken clocks are right twice a day," somehow managing the exact same audible shrug as the last loop.
Hal is upset that Gabbro would dispell Hornfels’ doubts the exact same way as the previous time.
Hal panics, thinking that Gabbro somehow lost their memories; but when they hear them asking about a different planet than the previous loops, picking up on the previous loop’s plan, they’re relieved, then annoyed. “Gabbro, you can’t start doing it too!”
“Doing what?” There was a pause. A metaphorical blink of realization. “…Oh.” Then a sigh. “Re<i>lax</i>, I’m still with you here.”
“Then why did you just—!?”
"Saying that worked just fine the last time," they retorted with a disappointed sigh. "You're the one wasting time here."
“What are you two talking about?”
Hornfels asks what this is supposed to mean, and Gabbro ignores them with an audible eyeroll.
“See what I mean? We could’ve gotten started with the real dirt a full minute ago with a lot less hassle if you’d just let me say that <i>one</i> sentence.”
“So you’re doing this because you can’t be bothered?”
“Because it’s more <i>efficient</i>.” And absolutely because they could not be bothered too, yes, but admitting it was just going to be counterproductive.

“You could’ve at least gone with a warning.”
“I told you last loop not to tell Hornfels, thought that was enough.” A small pause. “Sorry if that wasn’t clear. And, uh, sorry for all that, Hornfels. Guess now we <i>have</i> to tell you this time too, after all.”
“If I am… gathering well…” Their sentence trailed off, as they squinted and shifted their eyes from Hal to the radio receiver back and forth.
“A time loop?” Hal offered with a sheepish shrug.
“Yes. That can’t be right.”


“Hey Hal! Hornfels,” “Don’t mind me, I’m just here for the launch codes.”
"Of course," Hornfels said happily. "I have them written down somewhere around here, just let me find the note–"
"That one?"
Hal remembered where the note had been on the last loop, and had pointed towards without thinking. They might as well save a few seconds.
Hornfels blinked in surprise, following the hatchling's pointing finger and, indeed, finding the object of their search instantly. "…Why, thank you, Hal. I didn’t know you were so observant."
Hal simply kept their mouth shut, pressing their lips together in a thin line and taking a deep inhale through their nose.





During loops 4-5, Gabbro tries to explore the other islands and they manage to get to the Construction Yard? But even if they do, or even if they figure out that they can go beneath the islands, they have no translator. They also try to locate their ship, without telling anyone about it… But they either fail to do so, or realize that it is almost unusable and definitely beyond repair considering the time loop. Do they try to go and take a look at the north pole cyclone, wondering why it would be stationary and so big?

If Gabbro makes it to:
- Statue Island: get on top, look at the settlement and maybe send a scout through the roof (if they have one). Maybe figure out that it could be accessed from below.
- Bramble island: Feldspar’s old camp and message about getting to the core of Giant's Deep and then departing for Dark Bramble. Mind the ghost matter.
- Construction Yard:

Firn’s research from exploring the Attlerock ruins over and over: may lead to Brittle Hollow’s southern observatory, or to Ember Twin’s Quantum Moon locator; likely the former.






### Loop 4
"How many times–"
"Four," Hal cut in sharply, before instantly biting their lips and feeling purple flow through their ears. "Uh, sorry, I–"
"Nah, it's alright. I guess I already asked that one before, huh?"
Hal's breath was cut short; then released into a sigh. "Yeah. You did."
"So I've already been on the Attlerock four times?"
"Three times," Hal corrected, "your first time was–"
"Not the point," Firn looked down. "I've done the exact same thing three times, and you didn't try to stop me?"
Hal's fists started trembling. There was something they *could* say here, but they preferred not.
"Stop *you?* Firn. Be serious. Not even Hornfels could keep you in check on your *other* first launches."
Firn fell silent. When their radio crackled again, they uttered a single word devoid of any perceptible emotion.
"…Fair."
()
"Still, uh. If this happens again, and I forget *again*. Maybe give it a try anyway? I just can't believe I lost my time like this, and– Hal, it's not like I'm gonna snap at you or anything. You can tell me."
Hal did not have the heart to tell them that they had tried.
They did not dare say that, now that they had tasted it once already, the prospect of being ignored and dismissed felt even worse.








THIS IS A LOOP IN WHICH FIRN DIES EARLY, soon after they find out about the time loop and they decide to go explore.
Loop 4: Firn leaves the Attlerock and sets the autopilot for Giant’s Deep, intending to continue their investigation of Statue Island. They set the autopilot so they can take that time to catch up on the ship log.
Sadly, the autopilot sends them straight into the sun.
<span class=radio>“…Hey, is it getting hotter?”</span> <span class=radio>“W<span class=scaps>hat the</span>— <i>SLATE!</i>”</span>
Hal hears the horrible sound of a microphone being set on fire.
“F-<span class=scaps>f</span>irn?” they called out. “Firn, answer me! What happened!?”

Loop 4, when Firn died by getting sent into the sun:
Hal shook their head. "They’ll be alright," they mumbled shakily. "Time will go back and they’ll be all right again, th-they won’t even know—"

<p>Yes! YES!! I <i>knew</i> it! It really works! It’s completely crazy, but it <i>works!</i> Ha, I knew I’d be leaving some notes for myself. Great job, me.</p>
<p>But also OH GEEZ, oh no, the time loop is real and we’re already close to like halfway through. Why did Tephra have to rope me into a game of <i>hide and seek</i> of all things!? WHY DID I SAY YES???</p>
<p>Ok that means there’s no time for fooling around, it’s my turn to keep future me up to date and get as much work done as I can. The time loop stuff is DEFINITELY related to that weird Nomai statue business and apparently nobody ever managed to get to that statue workshop to investigate, so that’s where I’m going.</p>
<p>I’ll come back later with a full report. I’ll be leaving condensed notes in real time in the main ship log as usual, but I thought it’d probably be better to make a different version here as well at the end of each loop, just for me.</p><p>Though there’s probably going to be more rambling.

<p>“<i>Finally</i>,” came in the sigh of very, <i>very</i> out of place relief. “Oi, hatchling. You good?”</p>
<p>Hal bypassed Gossan without answering and ran up the road to the observatory before Marl could open their mouth.</p>
<p>Both stared in disbelief. The lumberjack pursed their lips and offered a hypothesis with a noncommittal shrug: “Think they just remembered they forgot something important?”</p>

Hornfels: "Since when are you invested in getting any kind of work done?"
Gabbro: "Even broken clocks are right twice a day," somehow managing the exact same audible shrug as the last loop.
One pair at a time, Hal rubbed their eyes with two exhausted fingers and tried not to audibly groan.



"Don’t mind me, I'm just here for the—"
Hal swiftly grabs the slip of paper Hornfels would usually give them and gives it to Firn before they can finish.
"…launch codes. Uh. Thanks, Hal."
Seeing that their friend was too shocked to think of actually taking the slip of paper, Hal realized that their actions may have appeared a lot more impatient and insensitive than they had intended.
They brought their arm back to their side and looked down. They had crumpled the note in their hurry, and even though they had to still be readable, they felt bad all the same. It wasn’t like them to act so careless. "…Sorry. I– We were in the middle of something." They were annoyed, sure, perhaps rightfully so, but… At the end of the day, it still wasn’t their fault. "I didn’t think…"
"No, no, it’s okay," Firn cut in while shaking their head in relief and reaching out for the note, "I didn’t want to interrupt whatever you were working on. It seems important."






### Loop 5:
Firn frowned, biting their lips. "How m—"
"Five. Five loops, fourth time you're on the Attlerock."
Firn hummed. "I guess I already—"
"And you already said that before, too," Hal sighed painfully.
A pause.
"I'm sorry."

<p>And also what was it about me last loop?? Saying ‘yeah i’ll give you some news soon’ and then just. Not. Did something… <i>stop</i> me from giving those news at the end of the loop?</p>

<!-- .
Hornfels: "Since when are you invested in getting any kind of work done?"
Gabbro: "Even broken clocks are right twice a day," somehow managing the exact same audible shrug as the last loop.

Hal asks Gabbro to get them out of here and loses it.




There is no access to the roof of the observatory, so in Loop 6, Firn rather takes Hal down the stairs, through the statue's room, and then sits on the ground by the nearby waterfall.






First few loops, Hal stays at the observatory; but after they had to deal three or four times with Hornfels repeating the same thing (being surprised at their radioing Gabbro, and being confused by everything they talk about), and with Firn taking some time to pass by, ask Hornfels for the launch codes, maybe have a word about the statue, Hal will have enough.

(Hornfels is about to repeat the same line as always, but Hal gets to the radio first and breaks down.)
“Gabbro, get me out of here,” they hurriedly cried into the microphone. “I-I can’t do this. I can’t <i>do</i> this.”
The radio crackled for a moment.
“…I get you, pal. But what… do you want me to do? Fish you out of the village?”
“I don’t know!” they cried out in desperation, giving up on trying to think of the means or consequences. “Anything but <i>this!</i>”
// “I’m begging you. I *can’t* deal with this every time.”
(A painful sympathetic pause) “…My ship was taken in a cyclone before the loops started, buddy. I would if I could, but…”
Hal’s mouth opened and slowly gaped.
Finally. <i>Finally</i>, they realized the real reason why Gabbro had been dragging their feet so much instead of taking their predicament seriously.
“You don’t know where it is,” they wheezed in pain and disbelief. “You lost— You’re the only other Hearthian who remembers— You’re the only astronaut who could possibly be of any use, and you *lost your ship*.” A sob came and strangled their breath. Shaking their head, a despaired whisper escaped their throat. “What did I do to get stuck with *you* of all people?”
From the side, with minute wariness, Hornfels bent forward to meet their gaze. “Hal, what on Hearth is…?”
Air whizzled through their teeth. “Not now, Hornfels. *Please*.”

(Firn comes by, asking for the launch codes.)
“Hey Hal! Hornfels,” a voice from behind greeted respectively with a friendly wave and a polite nod.
Hal gritted their teeth, shaking their head and feeling a sarcastic rictus slashing their face. “Don’t mind me, I’m just here for the launch codes.”
Firn stopped dead in their tracks. It was only when their mouth closed that Hal realized that this sad imitation of the puppet which used to be their best friend, had actually been said out loud.
With two pairs of eyes still wide and too full with shock to express any other kind of emotion, Firn pointed at them a joking but shaky finger, and a teasing but in reality intensely distraught smile. “…I don’t know how you did that, but please never do it again. That was beyond creepy.”
Hal could only stare back in disbelief.
Never do it again? Creepy?
Oh, the <i>irony</i>.
(Firn says something about . Gabbro makes a comment about Hal needing to calm down?)
Their head hurt. The mere sight of the ground control room, of the always static positions of the same Hearthians in the same places in circular space and time, was now making them nauseous.
Two of these Hearthians were now staring at them in shock. But why should they even care? These two would forget everything in a matter of hours, only to redo it all over again.
"Just go to the Attlerock, Firn," they mumbled hysterically, "the South pole locator needs you for the–the however many times you’ve been there."
Firn’s eyes furrowed, "The south pole what—"
"And then you'll try to write down some notes, and you'll see that your ship already has logs you don’t remember writing down, and you'll radio Hornfels, saying how weird it is, and then I'll have to tell you about the statues and the time loop and the *sun* all over again–"
"The sun–?" Hornfels parroted under their breath, only to be ignored by everyone, themself included,
"–because yes the sun is going to explode just like it did before, and how is anyone supposed to stop a *supernova* when the only one who remembers anything and should be able to do *some*thing about it has *lost their ship*—"
What stopped their tirade was Firn taking a strong grip on their hands, squeezing them tightly.
Hal did not look up. They could not– they dared not imagine what kind of face this ghost was making, let alone look at it.
"I— Okay I didn’t follow everything." Good, they likely shouldn’t have. "But I– You— What…" Firn shook their head. "No, I’m not gonna ask."
There was another squeeze, while they turned their head away and to the side: "Hornfels, I don’t know what you two were doing, but can I borrow Hal for a minute? They— Looks like they need some fresh air."
Wordlessly, mouth still agape, Hornfels simply nodded, letting know in their flabbergasted expression that they did not think their permission even needed to be asked.

There was a gentle but firm tug on their arms, and before Hal knew it, they were on the observatory’s rooftop. Looming over the crater was a star that still looked normal so far, but would soon be the blight to kill them all; only for the cycle to repeat.
"So. Uh." A sharp breath, a pair of hands letting go and deciding instead to violently clutch the guardrail separating them from an immense, somehow almost tempting fall.
Firn was still fumbling with their words. This was quite uncharacteristic of them, of how Hal remembered their best friend to be. But at least this was not… This was not a hollow echo of the things they would usually say.
There was silence. Hal did nothing to break it. It was the first time since this statue had acted that they were finally granted peace, and only in this instant did they realize how much they had needed it.
Perhaps the ghost of their best friend had, for once, said something actually helpful.
"You… Hal, you said– a *time loop*."
Seemed like silence break was over. Drats.
Firn let go of the guardrail and turned back to them, eyes shifting between concern and disbelief.
"I’m… Look, I can't just take your word– ugh." They were skeptical for sure… but they seemed to be at least considering it? Maybe?
Then again, what did it even matter? Just a bit more than two more sunrises and they would be back to blissful ignorance, and Hal back to a loneliness worse than absolute isolation would cause.
"Hal, I know you might want to get back at some of my jokes, but this *really* isn't funny."
Well, it seemed like they had settled for not believing them. In all honesty, they weren’t going to blame them for it. Logic was dictating that they were far more likely to be clinically insane.
And so they gave a painful snicker. "Hard agree."
Firn paused and looked at them expectantly, as if they were waiting for them to say anything more, such as something along the lines of *"Trust me, it's even less funny from my perspective."*
They were waiting for nothing. There was no such thing to say. Not to someone who was not taking them seriously, and not to someone who, even after being convinced somehow, would forget in no time.
"Whatever was going on in there was driving you crazy mad, huh?" Unfortunately, Firn had never been the kind to let go of anything without a hard fight. "If I were you, I'd probably have just busted my way out to get some fresh air and get it all out. Maybe setting a little thing or two on fire to vent the frustration if it really was that bad."
Hal gave a short huff through their nose, unsure themself whether it was out of annoyance, or if it was some sort of small repressed laugh.
"What? If it’s a time loop, then there would be no real damage done, right?"
Hal still remained silent and unmovable. Firn was stubborn, but they too could be.
…Or at least, Hal thought they were until Firn grabbed their shoulder and forced them to turn around, face to face with their hardened expression.
"The Attlerock," they asserted with as few tremors as they could afford, trying to trade their apprehension for determination. "Wanna come with?"
Hal froze, only realizing a second too late that their eyes had widened, showing an actual emotion for the first time in what felt like far too long.
"M-me? In *space?*"
The breaking of their mask, as well as their distraught answer, instantly made a corner of Firn's lips tilt upward, showing a small smug and triumphant grin. "What, you never tried *that* in your time loop?" …Smug, triumphant, and as always, full of sarcasm.
Firn’s raised eyebrow showed as much skepticism as they could muster; and yet, they were unable to conceal in their voice the fact that both their concern and offer, deep down, were close to genuine.
Hal looked down, over the edge, past the rusted sheets of metal.
(Something about Hal being excited, but also terrified of space; not having any training at all.)

They were not nearly as afraid of space as Riebeck was, but this was putting the bar at tripping height. And still, they had never been interested enough to attempt any kind of training, mostly out of being curious about space, but not fascinated about it; about being more interested in the Nomai than about the travels, and preferring to see the artifacts fall right into their hands with each traveler flying back home.
All in all, they were a linguist, the same way Riebeck was an archaeologist; but in comparison, they were just more… perhaps indecisive was the word.
And on top of this… After they had gradually seen their best friend dissolve piece by piece, replaced with a pale copy frozen in a loop, spending time with this fake Firn was just about the *last* thing they wanted to do.
But… What were they even talking about? This *was* Firn. Just like this was the real Hornfels, and everyone was the same. It was precisely the problem, that everyone was the exact same as they had been sunrises ago and *forever* ago, but… It was still *them*. They were still real.
They were still real, and this very real Firn was offering them a new scenario that had a chance to *finally* break the pattern, if only once.
Hal tried their best to swallow their tears, not willing to let them fall a second time. Then, taking a short breath:
"…Okay," they heaved in a pleading whisper. "But not the Attlerock. You've already told me all there is to see on the Attlerock."
// "You know what? Fine. Let's go."
// "?" "W-wait, I wasn’t…"
// "But not the Attlerock. You told me everything there is to know about the ruins." "It's a signal locator, by the way."

(Firn is noticeably hesitant, without showing why. The reason is because they did not expect Hal to actually take up the offer, and the fact that they do makes them question whether Hal may be forgetting, or no longer caring, about the dangers of space.)

"Well— Then it's settled. We'll think of a destination on the way."
Firn turned to the path downwards and gestured them to follow; but then, after a few steps, they stopped and facepalmed. "*And* I forgot the launch codes."
"MDN," Hal retorted with a shrug, not stopping.
"…*Right*," they nodded, "bet you saw them on Hornfels' desk. Multiple times." <i>Allegedly</i> went unsaid a fraction of a second before the word could reach their mouth.

(For later at some point:) "So," Firn asked jokingly, "where to, captain?"
"Giant's…" The word had escaped their lips before they had taken the time to think; but they immediately fell silent. Looking down and pondering again… they eventually shook their head slightly and corrected themself: "Ash Twin."
Firn gave a noncommittal hum. "Anything you'd like to see there?"
As far as they were aware, this was the only planet where they would not encounter a single living being, Hearthian or otherwise. Also, to their knowledge, the only planet in which nothing dangerous was going to take place, since the sand was draining out of it, rather than raining down on it.
"Not really. Just a lot of quiet and *nothing*, I guess. Not that I'll be stepping out of the ship at all anyway."
"You can take my suit if you'd like to go on a walk," Firn shrugged. "Ship can feel a bit claustrophobic."
Hal huffed weakly, shaking their head. "No thanks. If you ask me, being stuck in that thing and having your only source of air fed to you by a tube feels even *more* claustrophobic."
"Heh. Fair enough."

(They go to the ship, and while Hal is taking a nervous look around, they eventually are startled when they hear Firn mumble breathlessly:)
"What in the– oh stars above…"
Hal perked up their head, and before they could say anything, their lungs were robbed of all air by a tight embrace.
"[Insert swearing]. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
Hal blinked repeatedly, refusing to process that *Firn*, of all Hearthians in the whole crater, would ever be the one to willingly instigate a hug without prompting.
"You…" They almost did not ask. Somehow, they feared asking would jinx it. "…You believe me now?"
"You'd mentioned the ship logs while you were ranting," Firn mumbled shamefully. "I took a look. You were right. I'm sorry."
Hal found themself hugging back.
"How many loops has it been?"
Five. Objectively not that much. And yet, already too much for their sanity to fully give in and for the observatory to become the darkest of prisons.
Firn seemed to have taken their silence for a heavy answer with, likely, much darker implications than Hal had intended. "*Geysers*, Hal. And you never thought of just, like, walking *out* and doing literally anything else?"
"I’m not the one with the ship," their shoulders shrugged heavily, averting their gaze.
Firn frowned. "Well. Guess what, you have one now. And you'll have one every loop you want one."
"How would that even work? You're gonna…"
"Forget everything? We'll– we'll figure something out. Just let me process this whole– thing." They closed their eyes tight, took a deep breath, shook their head. "Just bear with me for like– just drag me here as fast as you can, show me the computer, and the ship is yours. Got it?"
()
"Hal, do you even… Do you know why your memories and the ship log don't get wiped out?"
"And Gabbro too," they corrected. "I think– We investigated a bit in some previous loops. It must be because of the Nomai statue." When Firn sent them a silent nod asking for clarifications, they obliged with a sigh: "The statue exhibit in the museum. On the first loop, it just… opened its eyes and messed with my head somehow. Gabbro had another statue do the same thing on Giant's Deep."
Firn's eyes slowly widened. "…and the ship's computer was made out of the part of the museum statue that got chipped by accident," they realized.
()
["Hal. Are there any other statues elsewhere?"] <— nope, Firn ponders this but doesn’t ask it out loud, thinking they don't want to bother Hal with too much thinking.


[…]
“…Five.”
Firn's head perked up, along with a hum of confusion.
“Five loops,” Hal admitted sheepishly. “Maybe six if we count the one where– never mind. This is… This is just the fifth time I’ve heard you do that whole ‘I’m just here for the launch codes’ thing.”
There was a second of stillness; then, Firn brought a hand to their chest and exhaled in immense relief.
“*Geysers*, Hal, I thought you’d been stuck for years or something.”
“I– Sorry, I didn’t…” They sighed, laughing sadly. “It’s just… so pathetic. I couldn’t even make it to the double digits before losing it.”
Firn sputtered in disbelief, shaking their head vehemently. “Hal, there shouldn’t even *be* a question of double digits. If anything, I’m *relieved* you got to let me know so soon.” Hal did not mention out loud that, technically, letting them know had never been the problem in the previous loops. “Like– *all* of those five times you’ve been in the ground control room with Hornfels, had to first tell *them* about the loop, and then you had to deal with *me* waltzing in asking for the launch codes–?”
“–and then leaving for the Attlerock, until about ten minutes later when you radio Hornfels or me and ask why your ship log has notes from the future.”
“Right,” Firn nodded severely. “Hal, that would have driven anyone *insane* in no time. And if it weren’t for me, you would have just– *stayed* there for even longer? Stars, I wouldn’t have expected that much patience from a <i>pine tree</i>.”
Hal strangled a few sputtering sounds before. “What else am I supposed to do? Steal your ship?”
“I mean, that’s an option if you have infinite time to practice and no lasting consequences on getting any injuries from it,” their friend shrugged.
“T-t-that would take me <i>ages</i> and I am <i>not</i> ready to find out other ways to <i>die</i>, Firn!” they cried out. “The supernova is bad enough!”
Firn paused, ears dropping alongside their assertiveness.
“Does it hurt?” they asked. “To die?”
Hal sent them a dark look. “You <i>know</i> I hate it when you pretend to be dumb just to encourage me to snark back at you. I don’t need your patronizing.”





[Once on Ash Twin, Firn offers Hal to have some quick time alone, and they use that time to start writing the first ship log entry which is specifically dedicated to talking to themself. They also suggest their future self try to pair with their own statue, saying they didn’t offer Hal to do it this time because they wanted Hal to just take a break.]
[……]

[]
Firn seemed to be typing furiously on their computer. In complete contrast, to the intent behind it, either the sound or Hal’s already present fatigue ended up lulling them to sleep.







Also during this loop, Firn actually got the scout out and took a photo of both them and Hal on Ash Twin, then sent it to the ship log's files, making it appear first, before even the message.
They also did it """accidentally""" while they were inside the ship, showing off their stuff to Hal and talking about the scout.
A flash of light suddenly blinded all four of their eyes, and they recoiled in surprise.
"Ow– Oh wow, that flash is *potent*." Firn turned to them with a sheepish smile. "Sorry, clumsy me. Those buttons sure are sensitive, huh?"



"ok so I'm not gonna remember the time loops. What is the fastest possible way to prove to my future self that Hal is not insane? Guess I could write tons of stuff in the ship log, and I've already done that, but I need to find a TL;DR version in case time limit is too tight. Hmmmmm…"
"This loop I managed to convince Hal to take a break and follow me in my ship into space. If I can prove that this happened…"
"Hey Hal, wanna check out the cool equipment in my ship? That's the Little Scout, it's super useful!"
*big flash of light*
"Ow- wow that flash is *potent*. Whoops, sorry for that. Those buttons are more sensitive than I thought, haha…"
—
Next loop, first thing Hal and amnesiac player see upon turning on the ship log is a selfie with a non-Timber Hearth planet in the background where Hal looks goofy AF
"So hey future me! Guess you’re wondering how I (aka you) managed to get Hal in space before you even had your first launch, right? >:D"






(They see the supernova going, and Firn tenses up, shivering.)
"Hal?"
They turned around with a confused hum, followed Firn’s pointing finger, and saw that something bright was… folding in on itself?
It took them a blink to realize that this was the sun. For an instant, they found themself mesmerized, still and speechless.
It always was the village’s night time, when it would start. And even if it hadn’t been, Hal had always been indoors, when it would happen.
"It's… it's going to be alright," they mumbled. "It only hurts for a second."
Hal was about to walk away, but a hand grabbed their arm and squeezed strongly.
Firn's pained expression hurt to look at. "So… That's it, right? See– see you next loop, I… guess? That's how it works?"
Next loop. Only then did Hal remember, again, what this truly meant; what was about to happen.
Eyes widening, they took a step back. "No." Not again. *Not again.* "You can’t. Please don’t do this…" They stared at the sun, filled with fear, grief, anger, talking to it as if these desperate prayers could somehow be heard.
Sensing both their friend’s distress and the general urgency of the situation, Firn chose to give their last moments of awareness as much meaning as they possibly could.
"Hal, listen to me," they pleaded with insistence. "Next time, don't bother with Hornfels. This morning I roasted a mallow or two with Slate– if you're fast enough, maybe you can catch me before I leave. Give me the launch codes yourself. Show me the ship log as fast as you can."
Hal was shaking, incapable of looking them in the eye. They were about…
"I don’t want to lose you," their lips shaped, without any air to turn those motions into words.
The sun, now only a small white sphere of condensed light, burst with pure immaculate plasma.
"Hal, you *won’t*, I promise. Please just bear with me for *one* more minute. Only that, no more."
They may have been grabbing their shoulders with all their might, but Hal only had eyes and ears for the end of their world. Firn’s words were heard, but hardly listened to, eventually becoming a blur of panicked wishes which Hal was unsure they would have the strength to grant.
"—I got an idea, there’s no time to explain but I wrote it down—"
Gabbro had described the supernova once or twice in the past loops. Poet as they were, though, no Hearthian words could ever be enough to express this raw display of power.
"—Hal, *please*, promise me you’ll do it, I swear you won’t regret it—"
For as devastating as the supernova was, as painful as it was about to be… This sight was beautiful. Dreadful, horrifying, cruel, uncaring, abhorrently *beautiful*.
Firn squeezed their shoulders, begging insistently. Hal’s fingers twitched.
"I promise," they said, even though they were unsure which part of their soon-to-be dead best friend they had just sworn an oath to.
Giving one last encouraging pressure against their arm, Firn decided to hold them tight under one last embrace. They only had time for one last sentence; and they used it when their eyes widened in sudden recollection. "…Wait. The ship log, I’m sorry—"
The supernova’s roar took their words, then their life. Somewhere in the land of three hours and forty minutes ago, Hal found their mind filled with memories of events they had never lived, of a promise to upkeep, and of a question powered with dread.

<div class=shiplog><h2>Reading Entry: “I want to scream what in the brambling GEYSERS was anyone THINKING before this and WHY DIDN’T HAL TELL ME ANYTHING.log”</h2>
<p class=time>06d05s 39:02</p>
<p>Screw you. Screw everything. Hal is in shambles and if I don’t figure out SOME kind of solution then nothing’s ever going to get any better because NOBODY ELSE seems to have ANY STARBLOWING CLUE how to make a change, and by the time they start trying it’s ALREADY TOO LATE.</p>
<p>I managed to get Hal in my ship, at least. That’s a new one according to them. So is blasting off into space, but that one isn’t too surprising.</p>
<p>They don’t like space. Or the ship. I tried my best to be steady and gentle, but even with that and the gravity crystal they <i>definitely</i> were trying not to throw up after the landing.</p>
<p>But that’s not even the worst part. I give them the opportunity to get <i>anywhere</i> they want in the entire solar system, and their first pick was the most BORING choice they could’ve ever made. And it was boring <i>on purpose</i>. Can you IMAGINE how broken and done with everything they must be if they picked ENDLESS SAND over like, I don’t know, literally <i>anything</i> with tons of Nomai writings to dive into and spend the entire loop reading in peace???</p>
<p>At least they seem to like the “novelty” and the fact that I <i>finally</i> got them out of that repeating cycle of being stuck with Hornfels and ME ASKING FOR THOSE BRAMBLING LAUNCH CODES. For <i>Hearth’</i>s sake, Hal, you KNOW the launch codes by now, why didn’t you just meet me at the campfire and show them to me right away?</p>
<p>...That being said I probably wouldn’t believe them and Slate likely wouldn’t be much help either. That’d just be a different kind of getting stuck. I don’t think Hal knows about <i>these</i> secret logs and I don’t even know for sure if they’d be convincing fast enough on their own because <i>I</i>’m still trying to wrap my head around the idea that a time loop could ever be real and I am not going to trust myself to not be a GEYSER JUMPING VOIDBRAIN if Hal isn’t already right in front of my face looking like they’re about to melt into a puddle AND explode at the same time. LIKE THEY DID THIS LOOP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now I gave them free reign over the pilot’s seat and they’re just napping on the controls. I think they’re crying.</p>
<p>So yeah. Screw you, me. Screw the time loop. Screw the entire universe. Hal doesn’t deserve any of this and I have been doing NOTHING to help them.</p>
<p class=time>06d05s 39:48</p>
<p>Oh RIGHT, I almost forgot: screw Gabbro too. You wouldn’t even REMEMBER <i>(HA)</i> they’re supposed to be in the loop with Hal given how LITTLE they’ve been contributing.</p>
<p class=time>06d05s 42:12</p>
<p>...........This is loop 6, by the way.<br>Maybe I should have started with that.</p>

<!-- .



Gabbro’s ship is going to have a reactor explosion if it does so much as have an impact with a cyclone or an island, or maybe even thunder could paralyze it and compromise the thrusters. It could be fixed, but not reasonably within the duration of the loop.


Start of loop 7:
Firn: "Hal! Hey, what brings you here? Didn’t trust me to see you at the observatory?"
Hal's lips trembled. "F– Firn, look. There's, uh…"
"I'll be *fine* in space, Hal."
"No, you don’t understand, there's something in your ship…"
"If even so much as a *cricket* had made it in there, you know Slate would have wrestled it out of the ship in no time."
"*It's not a cricket!*"
Firn startled, eyes wide. "Whoa– uh. Okay, serious talk, you good? You had a nightmare, or…?"
"Oh I *wish* it could be one," and oh stars, their voice cracked and water was getting caught in the corner of their lower eyes.
()
"Just– j-just *please*, *listen*, for once! We have to get in your ship!"
"First off, I need the launch codes for that–"
"I have them," Hal cut in with a glare,
"–and second, what do you mean, 'we'? This is my first *solo* launch, and since when have you even *wanted* to go to space?"
(Hal starts breaking down.)
"Please, it's– it's *important*. Your computer, there's – you said you’d have to look at your computer."
"That's a brand new ship, there's not gonna be anything in it," Slate cut in with a raise of an eyebrow.
"Yeah, it *shouldn't*! But it *does*!"
Slate and Firn exchanged a confused, worried look.
"Okay, that’s just impossible, but even *if* you were right, how would you know?"
"Why don’t you just *get up there* and find out!? I just—" (Hal lets out a scream, muffled by nothing but their own hands burying their whole face.)
"Oookay, okay," Firn *finally* conceded, "we’re going! Geez, what’s gotten into you today?"
Slate stood up from their log, glaring warily. "Yeah, and *I’m* taking a look to make sure neither of you two has messed with the ship while I wasn’t looking."






"Firn, wait! " "I have– Hornfels gave me the launch codes, you have the clear for launch." A lie, but technically Hornfels would have given both about an hour later anyway. "Mind– mind if I join?"
Firn blinked in surprise, before furrowing their eyebrows in a mixture between amusement, confusion, and the tiniest bit of annoyance. "I thought this was my first solo launch?"
"I'm not a pilot, I don’t count," Hal shrugged, trying to appear nonchalant.
They still did not seem any more convinced. "Since when did you even *want* to go to space? Wasn’t the whole point of building the translator so you wouldn’t have to go to the ruins yourself?" Well, that and the fact that the translator was still much faster than Hal's advanced but not yet fluent reading comprehension of the Nomai language, but still.
Also, going to space was indeed the part Hal was looking forward the least. "I, uh… changed my mind?" Not really, it just was that they would rather deal with zero-G and the horrors of the cosmos than spend one more second with Hornfels. And also, they had a promise to keep.
Firn crossed their arms. "I don’t know what this is about, but… What, did Marl rope you into some kind of prank?"
"Wha– No!" Past loop Firn had made it sound so easy. They had not signed for this. "Look, just– There's… something in your ship that you gotta see–"
Firn's blasé look became even more insistent, accompanying their eyes with an unamused nod. "Yeah, I bet. Something Marl planted there during the night?"
Hal sighed. "Just– just… come along. Please."
(What convinces Firn first each loop is the fact that the orbital probe cannon fires, something which nobody could have possibly orchestrated or predicted.)
The next time Hal took a look at Firn, they
"Okay, I think we should go meet up with Gabbro," they asserted with confidence, despite a slightly wavering voice. When Hal merely stared at them, they blinked in return and frowned, lips slightly trembling. "What?"
Hal blinked again. "That’s… That’s it? I mean, you’re just gonna…"
"Time loop, supernova, Nomai statues, Gabbro’s in it too, something on Giant’s Deep that might be worth looking into," they shrugged heavily. "Did I forget– Uh. I mean, anything else I should’ve listed?"
At a loss for words, Hal merely turned their eyes to the computer screen, then to Firn, back and forth. Finally, they managed to ask: "…What on Hearth did you write in that ship log that could convince you so quickly?"
"A few notes about the thing orbiting Giant's Deep that I saw exploding first thing this morning, and how it's literally impossible for my ship log to have any kind of info about that whatsoever unless, somehow, it already happened before. Which is impossible because the notes mention that the cannon was destroyed upon firing, and the cannon I saw this morning also was destroyed when it fired." "Also, the ship logs have dates, and I don’t think you or Marl would know how to hack it in order to make it look like those notes were written in the future."
After hearing this, Hal found that they needed just a few instants to merely process what had been said. Their eyes met with a small potted plant, and suddenly its tiny hatchling leaves felt like the most fascinating sight in the galaxy.
Past loop Firn had been adamant that the ship log alone would be enough to convince their future selves, but Hal had not dared imagine that it could possibly be so effective.
"You good, buddy?"
Hal blinked again. "Yeah– yeah. I… I'm just not– I'm no longer used to you being… No, I mean… Last loop you told me that you'd be easy to convince if I could show you the ship log, but I– I underestimated how effective that would be. Wow."
"Good thing that random cannon somewhere in space happened to be caught in the loop and explode right under my eyes, right?"
"…Yeah."
Had Hal not been already too happy and relieved to finally have the universe do them a favor for once, they almost might have pondered about just how lucky this was, and whether it truly could have been nothing but pure coincidence.
Hal was not the type of Hearthian to jinx their own good fortune, however, and therefore did not give this thought more than a single distracted second.
"So, ready for launch?" Firn asked from over their shoulder. Hal was startled again, only now noticing that their pilot friend was already seated and buckled up, even in their suit, and was merely waiting for their signal. "Giant's Deep, right? I was thinking, and… Unless the ship log forgot to mention it, there's something I'm curious about that we didn’t try yet."
"Like what?"
"The statues are what lets you, the ship, and Gabbro remember, right?"
"That's the current hypothesis, yeah."
"And your statue came from the same place as where Gabbro got theirs. There's gotta be more than just those two, right?"
"Are you saying…?"
A serious nod. "I want in. I'm not leaving you alone in this mess."

When they all see the photo:
Firn’s jaw dropped. Slate would be howling with laughter if they weren’t so busy being shocked at the sight and trying to make any sort of sense of it. Hal’s grip on the ledge of the desk tightened, suddenly remembering the previous loop’s seemingly inconsequential <i>incident</i> with the little scout.
“You— That was on <i>purpose!?</i>” they strangled, bringing a shaking hand to their forehead. “Why you– y-you <i>voidbrain</i>…”
Firn could not tell whether Hal was laughing or crying.
()
"Did you <i>have</i> to do it like this?"
"If… uh… I-I think that might have been part of the plan? Maybe?"
"Yeah, pranking me across time and space. Of course you would come up with something like that."
"And– and I think that’s the <i>point</i>–" "You wouldn’t have made that face if you were in on it. This isn’t <i>just</i> a prank, Hal. It's proof that <i>you</i> didn’t set it up. It's proof that– that <i>I</i> set it up, somehow."
"Because of the time loop," Hal mumbled.
Firn nodded heavily. "Because of the time loop."
Hal buried their head in one hand, rubbing their forehead.
"…You are the worst. You are the *absolute* worst."
"Well, uh– as long as it works?"
Firn swore they heard Hal mumble under their breath something about this still being better than the observatory. Whatever that meant.



Slate also gets up in the ship.

“Hal. It took you forty minutes to convince me that there was a time loop to begin with, and Slate got involved, which means we both slowed you down way more than we can afford to, and– way more than you’d feel comfortable in the long run, I bet. Sure can’t… I can’t imagine you going through that again even just a <i>second</i> time, given how awful the first was on its own.” “I don’t care if it’s just your [xth] time around and if you might find a more optimized way down the line—my point is that you shouldn’t <i>have</i> to. I’m not making you go through that. Even if the loops—<i>especially</i> if the loops just keep going on and on.”
“T-there won’t, I’m sure we’ll solve the problem soon—”
“Hal, either you’re lying about us having three sunrises to stop the <i>sun</i> from <i>blowing up</i>, or you’re lying right now about how easy it’s gonna be.”
[]
“My mind isn’t gonna change until <i>maybe</i> I see the sun explode and I start having second thoughts, but that means that if I’m not allowed to remember, that’s not gonna change in the next loops either. I want in, and that’s final.”

“Also, I don’t think you have time <i>or</i> the nerves to afford getting Slate involved in this every time,” Firn said gravely. Pursing their lips, they glanced sheepishly at the Hearthian in question and quickly added: “No offense, Slate.”
The founder rolled their eyes. “None taken. I think. I get where you’re coming from.”
“It’s just that dealing with <i>me</i> is bad enough,” they grunted with resentment.

-->
<wip>Right after the photo, Firn finds an audio recording:</wip>
<p class=vs>If the photo on its own had somehow not been enough and Firn had ever needed any more convincing by this point, what came next was the nail in the coffin for their last traces of doubt.</p>
<p>As soon as the recording started and the crackling of what had to be the phantom sound of the static caused by a button being released ended, the young cadet was met with the sound of <i>their own voice</i>.</p>
<p class=radio><i>“‘Sup, future me? …Or ‘next loop’ me, I guess. Or however that works. Whatever, I’ll just go with ‘future me’, it’s not like it’ll matter for long.”</i></p>
<p class=vs>Hal staggered back, grabbing a wall in order to keep their balance. The other two Hearthians froze into stupor, jaws somehow dropping even lower than the first time.</p>
<p>The recording did not wait for any of them to recover.</p>
<p class=radio><i>“So, I bet you have a lot of questions right now. Sure had a ton of those when it was </i>my<i> turn to see notes I couldn’t possibly have written myself, and photos of space right inside my computer with a whole day’s worth of exploring.”</i></p>
<p class=vs>Firn found themself nodding, or perhaps just trembling their head up and down a little bit.</p><p>Slate had to catch Hal in order for them not to collapse to the floor.</p>
<p class=radio><i>“If I set things right and the photo was the first thing to show up when you turned the screen on– Yep, that’s you and Hal on Ash Twin. So now that I’ve got your attention, I hope you’ll spend a minute or two checking the rest… But, uh, if you’re listening right now, I guess it means you were doing just that, heh. There’s a quick rundown of everything you need to know in there, so go check that out <i>before</i> you ask Hal any questions, got it?”</i></p>
<p>Hal brought both hands to their mouth, trying not to scream, or wail, or make any sound. They could not dare disturb what had to be, if only from their perspective, the previous ghost of their best friend’s last words.</p>
<p><i class=radio>“Anyway,”</i> the recording continued, <i class=radio>“there’s no time to lose, so I’ll be signing off here. Good luck.”</i></p>
<p>“<i>No!</i>” Hal cried back, shaking themself off Slate’s grasp and scrambling to the screen as the air turned to static. “<span class=scaps>d</span>-don’t leave…”</p>
<p>The record ended. Tears rolled down their cheeks. Slate tentatively placed a shaking but supporting hand on their shoulder, not daring to look or move a single other muscle. Firn’s legs gave in as they kneeled down for a hug.</p>
<p>There was a sniff. “Right before the… before you…” Hal sobbed before burying their glassy eyes in their hands. “Y-you’d asked me to bring you here and show you the ship log. I-<span class=scaps>i</span> tried… I tried my best, but…”</p>
<p>Firn and Slate exchanged a heavy look in silence. Turning back to Hal, the younger one tightened their embrace, trying not to let the bubbling rage within them escape their chest. “I’m sorry I made it so hard for you.”</p>
<p>“They said they had a plan,” Hal stuttered weakly. Trembling, they raised their head and turned it to face that of their friend’s current iteration; and Firn realized that, for the very first time this morning, their eyes were looking <i>at</i> them, instead of <i>through</i> them. Hal gulped, now overcome by a wave of guilt, before they corrected their earlier sentence: “…<i>You</i> said you had a plan.”</p>
<p>Firn’s ears flattened as they stood back in shocked silence, incapable of finding the strength to remind them that even if that were true, they no longer had any idea of it. Their lips pinched into a thin line as they took a short, tense breath; but they instantly frowned with determination.</p>
<p>“I managed to leave a photo and a whole recording, I must have left notes about that plan <i>some</i>where for sure,” they assured. “And even if I haven’t– I got that plan figured out <i>during</i> the loop, with <i>less</i> information than we’re gonna get this time. I’m just gonna come up with it again.”</p>



<wip></wip>
<p>“Slate… You won’t tell anyone that Hal’s coming with me, right?”</p>
<p>The engineer closed their eyes and raised their hands, the corner of their lips trying to tilt up teasingly. “As long as this ship launches and the cockpit stays attached during liftoff, I’m not gonna complain.”</p>
<p>Hal’s ears dropped and they gulped, stuttering a tiny <i>“W-what do you mean, ‘stay attached’?”</i>. Firn frowned and glared at the founder, grunting that <i>maybe</i> they could have kept that kind of comment to themself.</p>
<p>Slate’s joking attempt at a smile faltered completely as they bent down and opened the hatch, ready to jump out and let them go. They still tried to show comfort when they replied: “Relax, we got proof you managed a whole liftoff and landing on your own and that it went <i>just fine</i>,” they shrugged lightly. “Just watch out for the thrust-to-weight ratio, this beauty wasn’t designed with passengers in mind. But– well, again, you two took off once already, so I reckon that won’t be an issue this time either.”</p>
<wip>(Slate jumps out and rides the elevator down)</wip>
<p class=vs>Wait. Wouldn’t the other one need a spacesuit, at least? Did Firn have a spare one?</p>
<p>…Meh. They would manage. They’d be surprised if Hal planned to actually step out of that ship while in space, anyway.</p>
<hr>
<!-- .
— Ship log notes:
<li>Apparently from the past loops, we got to discover that there’s a whole workshop on Giant’s Deep. There’s <i>bound</i> to be tons of other statues there!</li>
<li>Maybe we could even pull a few others in it too, like Hornfels. It’d be super useful to have ground control support, and Hal wouldn’t even <i>have</i> to go to space to avoid them anymore. (I mean, of course they’re still welcome, it’s just that I don’t think they’re really enjoying their time out there.)</li>

Slate slowly shook their head. “This is positively insane.”
Firn eyed them, deadpan but trembling in their voice. “You see any other way around explaining this?”
The engineer returned their blasé look with a huff, opening their mouth with a retort ready to accuse the newest astronaut of having orchestrated it all. However, deciding to take just one last second to consider every step which would have been required in order for such orchestration to have been even remotely achievable in the first place, they remained silent; and then, judging that a great majority of these steps were at best unlikely to occur, at worst entirely unfeasible short of a village-scale conspiracy built from the ground up and carefully maintained for weeks with no concrete objective other than to bamboozle them specifically for a grand total of perhaps five minutes at most, they closed their mouth in frustration.
“My previous statement and your answer being ‘no’ are not mutually exclusive,” they begrudgingly grouched instead.







Loop 7: Hal goes to the ship and embarks without a spacesuit, Firn puts theirs on upfront. But when they go to Giant's Deep, Firn struggles with the landing and the cockpit's front window ends up cracked. Hal suffocates, Firn is traumatized for the whole loop, and next loop Hal hesitates on doing anything, until Hornfels comes get them (or someone Hornfels sent) because Gabbro has been insistently radioing, asking that Hal go radio them (preferably using the radio on Firn's ship).
This is the incentive Hal is given to take the suit from the zero-g cave.

"You know what Feldspar would always say: Any landing you can walk away from is a good landing."
"Feldspar went *missing*, Firn."
()
"Don’t worry, I've got this! That's what we call a slingshot, you'll see."
(Firn actually starts by making a full rotation around TH (or rather passing by BH? in which case they would dodge a few Lantern projectiles?) in order to acquire acceleration, before launching the ship towards Giant's Deep.)
()
Firn smirked, inching forward in anticipation; then their stance shifted at once, taking the joystick along with them. "And *now*," they concluded with the confident flip of a button, "is the time for the retrorockets."
()
"Uh, we're… we're going a bit fast, don't you think?"
"Relax, we'll be slowing down soon. It's all part of the plan."
Firn's confident smile melted when they realized that they were, in fact, not slowing down.
In their defense, their manoeuver would have worked perfectly with any astral body in the universe, provided it was the size of Timber Hearth. Could anyone blame them for forgetting to account for Giant's Deep's doubled gravity?
…Yes. Probably.
Fixed as they were, Slate's brand new retrorockets could never have been enhanced enough to correct their trajectory this late into the procedure.
A solid four out of ten if accounting for the pilot, eh? Darn it.

Loop 7, Hal took so long inputting the launch codes that Firn had the time to take note of them. When Hal dies in the crash, Firn gives the launch codes to Gabbro and asks that they give them to them in the next loop as fast as possible.
Loop 8, Gabbro radioes Slate:
"–Checking, checking… Slate? Did I get the right frequency?"
"…Gabbro?"
"Nice. Hey, uh, weird request, but could you pass the radio to the rookie?"
Slate sent the rookie in question a frowning look; in response, they obtained a wordless exaggerated shrug conveying the full scope of their shared ignorance. About half a second was spent before Slate was convinced enough to detach their radio and toss it in the new pilot's hands, eyes wide with confusion and curiosity.
Ears twitching with a surplus of energy, Firn tentatively brought the radio closer to their face. "Uh… Hi?"
"'Sup. Just keeping a promise, but I've got the launch codes. Do yourself a favor and take a look at your ship log first thing you climb up, will ya?"
(Slate climbs as well, suspicious and wanting to know what could have possibly happened to the ship log.)
Slate slowly shook their head. "This is positively insane."
Firn eyed them, deadpan but trembling in their voice. "You see any other way around explaining this?"
The engineer returned their blasé look with a huff, opening their mouth with a retort ready to accuse the newest astronaut of having orchestrated it all; but, deciding to take just one last second to consider every step which would have been required in order for such orchestration to have been even remotely achievable in the first place, they remained silent; and then, judging that a great majority of these steps were at best unlikely to occur, at worst entirely unfeasible short of a village-scale conspiracy built from the ground up and maintained for months with no concrete objective other than to bamboozle them specifically for a grand total of five minutes at most, they closed their mouth in frustration.
"My previous statement and your answer being 'no' are not mutually exclusive," they begrudgingly grouched instead.
(When they both are done being convinced of the time loop and Firn caught up on what happened the previous time:)
Firn sputtered in shock and bewilderment. "Hal is *dead!?*"
"Nahhh. I mean, we all die every few hours now, but we always come back after that and you guys don’t even realize it. It's just Hal and I who remember." "Speaking of them though, I have yet to hear from them this loop and I don’t like that they didn’t meet up with you by now. Methinks they might be hiding somewhere, sulking. Or trying not to think about dying. Or still recovering from their death, maybe. You, uh, might want to go check on them soon is all I'm saying."
Firn drops everything and jumps out of the ship before darting back to the village, almost breaking their legs in the process as they jumped from higher heights than they should have.
()
Slate: "…You tried a *slingshot* to save five minutes?"
Firn could easily imagine it, and imagine why. If time was limited, if they were so close to what they believed was going to be an exhilarating breakthrough, if they were planning to bring a game-changing variable to Hal and Gabbro's nightmarish statu quo, and if the opportunity to make it happen ever so faster had offered itself…
Firn's ears dropped sheepishly. "Please don’t tell Gossan."
They barked in mocking laughter. "As far as we're concerned, this ship has yet to lift a single centimeter off the ground. Just (try to) [use your brain better/don't forget your brain] next time." (Though there is the tiniest restraint in their hilarity due to nihilistic dread)
()
When they go look for Hal, they realize that Gossan and Marl got them in Gneiss' cabin for treatment. Hal started the loop collapsing into tears and screams, clutching their chest, and that along with the sudden freezing got everyone thinking that they had a sudden heart attack of some sort. Hal kept weeping all the while, being seemingly delusional and wanting space, feeling despair at the fact that they cannot escape anywhere and that dying in space was even worse than dying to the sun.
()
When Firn arrives, they rush to hug them, struggling to tear up as well.
"I'm sorry. I'm *so* sorry," they muttered on loop like a mantra, only to wonder whether they should stop doing exactly that.
Hal pushed them away as gently as they could with their trembling limbs, glaring piercing probes from their four eyes and right through Firn's skull. "Sorry… sorry for *what?*" they asked, betraying in their tone that they knew the answer all too well, but that they wanted to hear it straight from their mouth.
Firn glanced behind their back, spotted Gossan who was still here, and pinched their lips shut. They bent forward to whisper directly into their ear: "I'm sorry I tried a *slingshot* and crashed like an idiot."
With a gasp, Hal pulled them away again— "Y-you *remember!?"
Firn's ears dropped at once. "N-no. I'm sorry, I… Gabbro showed me. And Slate, too. I wrote down a few things about it after the crash, apparently. Turns out I… y-you were the only one who…"
The astronaut found themself unable to finish their sentence, just as they were unable to keep their throat and eyes and nose from crying out in anger and drowning in guilt.
(Their past self had taken a photo of Hal's corpse as a "do NOT try that EVER again" warning)
(Either way, Hal's glare melts back into despair, and they impulsively push them away as they grab the bed sheets and bury their head inside it, mufflying both cries and screams.
(Instead of Hal, it is Gossan who goes on Giant's Deep along with Firn, as they want to first see what the ship log is all about, and then because they read about Firn's plan and wants in as well. Hal stays on TH to recover.)
(Because Firn is still crying at the sight of the photo of their ship's wreckage and a lifeless Hal impaled by the broken glass of the hull, Gossan decides to be the one piloting.)
The fifth sunrise already. If Gabbro's estimation was correct, Timber Hearth would be no more before the seventh.
Gossan felt a shiver run down their entire body. Unable to bear showing their fear, however, they placed a steady hand on the cadet's shoulder. "I know this was supposed to be your first launch," they stated gravely and with the tiniest traces of urgency that escaped their restraint. "That being said– it seems like we are on a time limit, and given the circumstances… you don’t look in the right mindset to be piloting, are you."
Firn repressed a sob, flinching at the very words they had so desperately hoped to never hear; at the words they found simultaneously unjust and wholly deserved. Their closed trembling fists wanted to set their rage free, to lie that they were fine, to punch through the chains and finally fulfil their dream, incapable of accepting that it could be taken away from them at the last moment, that it could have turned into their worst nightmare before they could even have been given the chance. But they kept their silence and, head hanging low, they nodded. Gossan gently came closer and brought their other hand to their back, guiding the hatchling's head to cry their heart out into their chest.
When Firn's arms let go, Gossan followed in turn; and after one last eye exchange in which they tried to convey all their compassion, they turned around and buckled up in the pilot's seat.
The signalscope was turned towards Giant's Deep, letting the slow hum of a flute fill the air, and Gossan turned the radio to broadcast.
"Gabbro, do you copy?"
The flute stopped instantly, and the silence was soon broken by the unpleasantly loud but very welcome sound of a hand picking up the radio. "Yep. Everything good down there?"
Their one upper eye flicked to the corner of their vision, but was not able to catch sight of the young cadet behind their back. "Could be better. Listen, Firn and I are on our way to you. If you know where the statues are, please make your way there and start playing so I can follow you." "I assume you know what we've come to do?"
"Frankly, the plan didn't involve you," Gabbro admitted with no urge nor restraint. "But if it works and you want in, we're not gonna stop you. Would be great to have a responsible adult."
Gossan sighed with exasperation. "Call me gullible, I almost dared hope that this sort of dire situation would finally push you into behaving like one."
The radio turned silent for a while.



Maybe also make it so that it's not *only* Firn's fault that they crash on Loop 7. They manage to redirect their ship away from a crashing line and tries to use the atmosphere to slow them down, just staying up in the air and flying over the surface through the clouds, but then the crash occurs because of an island flying or falling into the ship, or because of the downward cyclone.
After Hal dies, Firn and Gabbro spend the rest of the loop brainstorming and planning the next one. At some point, they manage to get Gabbro's ship somewhat working (show here that Firn is the engineer of the group, good at fixing things, though Gabbro is also knowledgeable about it when they pay attention), though it is clearly struggling and sparkling and both half expect it to explode and kill them both if either does so much as dare to push the thrusters too little too hard. Most parts have had irreversible water damage which makes it usable, but not in any way safe.

When Gabbro and Firn are about to launch in Gabbro's ship in order to watch the supernova:
"You sure you want to come? I'd wager the probability of this ship exploding before the supernova does is, uh, closer to a hundred percent than to zero."
“Gonna die either way, aren’t we?” Firn retorted darkly. Their grip on the backrest tightened, as they added: "Let’s find out how."


They get into orbit, and try to time the supernova so that Gabbro can tell them next loop, that way Firn can integrate into their ship a "sun goes supernova in one minute" alarm, along with warnings for each planet being engulfed one by one. Maybe if they're quick enough, they can land back on Giant's Deep and write down the time before dying. (Though Firn can just send the info remotely to the ship log)
Next loop, at some point:
Gabbro: "Two minutes before the seventh sunrise. That's when the sun explodes. Took around XX:XX for the supernova to reach Giant's Deep if memory serves."









"Can’t you tell how far your ship is from your current location?"
Gabbro's head rose up and back, staring as if Firn had grown a second head. "Can you?"
"Well, *yeah*. As soon as I leave my ship I get a marker in the corner of my visor."
There was a huff, and Gabbro turned around, walking away. "I see Slate had fun with those shiny new features since they were finished with mine. Lucky you."





Loop where Firn tries to pair with a statue. Firn is surprised that Gabbro is actively helping.
"Well, they're in space without any kind of training, so they need a responsible adult to make sure they don't die too often."
Hal simply stared in disbelief.
"Fine, Hal gets the adult points. But they still need a competent astronaut," they soon corrected.
Hal's brows furrowed deeper. "Who managed to lose their ship before the loops started."
"Fine, fine," they conceded with arms raised in defeat. "But at least I have the first aid training and flight experience."





Seeing something ahead, Firn gave a short gasp and trotted for a few dozen meters.
"There’s a statue here!" they exclaimed; but their enthusiasm soon died down the moment they got close enough to have a better look. "…But its eyes are already opened."
"Yeah, that one’s mine," Gabbro mumbled, refraining from adding that they already had seen it before, just that they… did not remember doing so.
Gabbro not having said it did not mean that Firn did not have the ability to make that guess on their own. "Ha… Right. I should’ve assumed yours would be the first we’d find. We’re not even inside the workshop yet."
(Hal feels conflicted about how antsy and restless Firn looks, with their hands shaking with some kind of trepidation that comes neither from fear nor from joy, but solely from the visceral rejection of the unknown, and the sheer drive to fish out knowledge and objectives out of the obscurity.)



Loop where Firn tries to pair with a statue: they die early.
Fighting against a sleep they felt they would not wake up from, they tried to align at least one or both pair of eyes with those of their best friend, hovering over them. Between two coughs, they painfully managed to whimper: "Please don't… forget me."
Hal shook their head vehemently, still trying to stop their bleeding. "You'll be alright," they retorted shakily, "time will go back and you'll be all good again, hang on—"



“Hey, uh. I was thinking.” “If the statues are responsible for keeping you aware of the loops, then… think we could try finding a third one for me?”
Hal blinked hard, staring at them in shock. “You. You <i>sure</i> about this, Firn? That’s… Being in a time loop is <i>not</i> fun. Dying in a supernova once already sucks, dying more than once is even worse.”
Firn returned their look, staring with all four eyes with purpose and determination. Their mind was already set. “I’m the one with the translator. My ship’s the only thing that can hold any tangible notes about anything. If I’m gonna be your pilot, then I’ll just be a pain in your back if I don’t remember.”
“We can manage that—” This was a lie.
“And I know you’re just saying this because you care,” they retorted while shaking their head. “And <i>I</i> care about you too. I don’t want to be holding you back like this every time, I’m sure in the long run that’d be even worse than if you just stole the ship and ignored me completely.” Before they could get a single word in, Firn was already shaking their head again, with even more resolve. “That’s why I want in, Hal. I hate knowing you’re in it alone.”
“I’m not <i>alone</i>, there’s still Gabbro, remember?” they shrugged while arching their eyebrows in a sorry and somewhat offended way.
Firn dropped their head to the side and gave them A Look. Hal’s shoulders slumped and they sighed heavily.
“It’s… It’s really not that bad, I swear. They’ve been helping. I don’t know whether they care about stopping the loops, but they care about <i>us</i>, they really do. They’ve been helping when it mattered.”
“Yeah, and I don’t think they have the same threshold on <i>when</i> things matter,” Firn whispered back. “No offense to them, really. I haven’t seen them in the previous loops. But if they’ve been like how they are in this one, then… It looks like they just gave up on trying. Like they think there’s no way to solve this. Like the only reason they’re doing anything is because <i>you</i> are trying to solve it and they don’t want you losing your mind over it.” They sighed. “It just… It still feels lonely. You <i>sound</i> lonely, Hal. And I can’t take it.”

They go to Giant’s Deep, find a couple finished ones. Taking a gulp, fists clenched, ears twitching from inside their helmet, Firn took a stiff breath, then stepped forward. Slowly, but then with purpose, they walked closer and closer. Then, everyone waited. One second, two.
Nothing happened.
Firn clenched their teeth, gripped one of the closest statue’s top horns with fierce and desperate hands, bent down to a knee to stare at its closed eyes with as much intent as they could; with more determination than the universe itself. When they still did not see anything happening, ignoring their sense of self-preservation by hardly checking if trees were nearby, they removed their helmet just so the visor would not be in the way, and so they could inch ever closer to the point that their forehead was practically clashing against the stone fur.
The eyes did not open.
“Maybe… Maybe this one’s just broken,” Firn said with a hollow voice, far too high-pitched for them. “I’ll try with another one.”
Hal’s lips trembled. “Firn…”
“I’m not leaving you two alone in this,” they cut sharply, voice back to its normal pitch, but this time filled with venom. “I’m not abandoning you like this. I can’t. I <i>won’t</i>.”
Pacing across the room, they stopped by one statue, then the next, then the one after that, each time getting more frantic and impatient. When their fist started raising into the air, ready to hit, two fellow Hearthians were needed in order to stop them from puncturing their glove by having them clash against the sharp edges of petrified fur made of sharp edges, and pull them back against their wishes.
“Firn, please,” Hal pleaded with a sob. “Stop. This isn’t… This isn’t working.”
Gabbro put a comforting, but so distant and foreign hand on their shoulder.
“Deep breaths, buddy,” they advised with a calm sigh, giving an example by following their own words. “You can’t do anything about it. It’s not your fault.”
Firn’s hands covered their watering face, no longer capable of holding their sobs.
“I’m sorry. This is unfair. This is <i>so</i> unfair.”
The grip on their shoulder shook just ever so slightly, insistant. “Firn. Buddy. <i>Not your fault.</i> Just let it go.”
[…]
“The statues activated on the same loop for the both of us,” Gabbro explained slowly. “Maybe that was the only loop where it could have happened.”












Stone, and stone, and more stone. How could a single living soul in the universe expect them to tinker with Nomai technology when there was not a trace of machinery anywhere? How did the Nomai do any of what they had accomplished?

It is only later, thanks to Solanum, that they obtain some information on how to use a Nomai staff and tinker with Nomai technology, and therefore learn that it is about imbuing stone with information using those staves; meaning that save for the Ash Twin project, there are no tangible cables to tinker with. This is why even after being chipped and repurposed, the ship log's data still resonates with Hal’s mask and is still stored equally. Hal is the only one who manages to get good at using a Nomai staff, with Gabbro being barely able to, but hardly due to their inability to understand the language.











— End of loop 7, Gabbro and Firn time the supernova. They do that from a spot at 90° according to the Deep Space Satellite, far enough away to be out of range of the supernova. But the recording won’t be able to save beyond GD’s destruction.
Gabbro decided to break the ice. "So. uh. To anyone listening after the fact, gotta give a warning— this is going to get morbid."
"That's *one* way to put it," Firn huffed with a broken laugh. "We're gonna watch the supernova. and…" A gulp. "…take notes."
"If the ship's in good enough condition to receive and record this transmission as it goes, then that'll be convenient. If not, let's hope I can memorize well enough. But I'd much rather put my mallows on the first option."
Firn gave them an indecipherable look. Silence returned, neither of them knowing how to continue the conversation during the wait.
Gabbro eventually bent down, with a sigh. "You'll see, when the sun goes– it looks… beautiful. Far prettier than anything I'd seen. For a harbinger of death, it sure has charisma." Turning to their companion in misfortune, they found a look of disgust, and turning away again, they chuckled darkly. "And that's why I won’t be looking. We both need me to stay focused, so I'll just be staring at the clock. You tell me when to give you the time, and I'll say it out loud. Gonna try to memorize it too, but. Hope the transmission will have made it in good enough condition next time."
Firn took a sharp breath. "Gotcha."
And the wait started.
()
"Oh– t-there it goes!" Firn cried out. "It's collapsing!"
Gabbro scrambled for the clock on their screen, having somehow for a split second forgotten how to read. "F-fifty-five minutes, thirty-two seconds," they stammered hurriedly.
// Firn watched as the sun crumpled in on itself, trying not to shake or sob. The size of the star decreased, and decreased, until it bounced back. They immediately announced it. "Time."
"And… Time."
"Fifty-six, fifty-eight."
"Sun just went– boom. At fifty-six minutes, fifty-eight seconds," Firn decided to clarify for the sake of the audio recording.
They took a sharp breath, shuddering. A morbid idea creeping up in the back of their head,
[…]
— Start of Loop 8, Slate and Firn, with Gabbro on the radio, get to listen to it.
"So this is going to get morbid," sounded the voice of none other than Gabbro themself.
[…]
There were some shuffling sounds, and suddenly the recording crackled with distant static and the sound of drums.
"…Oh Firn," the Gabbro from the recording sighed with a wavering voice, audibly unable to find any words other than: "Why?"
"It's…" From the sounds of it, the hatchling was not doing any better. "The Twins are too far to see clearly. I-it's another… indicator."
Soon enough, the drums were replaced with silence, then with a horrible sound, not unlike what one might expect duct-taping a microphone to a marshmallow and then setting the whole on fire would sound like.
"Time," Firn wheezed shakingly.
"Fifty-eight fifty-one."
Silence returned. Whistling started, and somehow, the phantom sounds of a harmonica came along with it, like the whisper of a ghost.
()
"Tim—T-Timber Hearth," Firn choked.
A pause. "Fifty-nine thirty-four."
"And, well, rather– Esker. That was for the Attlerock. *Stars*, Gabbro, I can't believe we're doing this."
"Me neither. Hope we can at least– make something useful out of it."
A short pause. "Future me, if this works, you better do something cool with– whatever it is we're doing."
A few seconds flew by.
Without prompting, Gabbro announced flatly: "Seventh sunrise."
A choking noise was sputtered out. "R-right after it got—!? Are you serious…?"
"I don’t get to tell the sun what to do, buddy. I'm just reading the clock."
Another pause. Some sounds of shuffling. From elsewhere and elsewhen, banjo strings were being plucked. And then…
"There goes Riebeck."
"XX XX."
Silence. A sharp breath.
Gabbro was first to break the silence, attempting to be comforting. "…Ready?"
"N-no…"
"Yeah. Me neither."
Silence. Then, Firn gasped.
"Giant's Deep…"
The recording reached its natural end. Slate turned the screen off.
The radio crackled. "…Seventh sunrise, XX:XX. Last numbers I saw before it became too bright. Gonna have to re-time it though, we were from orbit so there will have been some delay." A quick pause.
(IMPORTANT NOTE: They actually managed to get out of orbit and beyond the white hole in Gabbro’s ship, it’s just that the ship wasn’t able to save the second recording they made for after Giant’s Deep was destroyed. Gabbro notes that they do remember what happened and that they weren’t even killed by the supernova, despite the fact that their statue definitely was destroyed alongside Giant’s Deep; and they note that the ship, however, could only keep gathering data for as long as it was intact.)
Slate was shaking. "You voidheads… I can't believe I listened to all that."
From hundreds of kilometers away, Gabbro raised an eyebrow. "Still not convinced?"
"Oh I am convinced alright," the engineer sputtered with venom, "I just can't believe you *did* this. You just…"
"…took it? Wasn’t my first time," Gabbro answered with a metaphorical, heavy shrug.
Slate turned to Firn, ready to scold them as well— but they were met with the silent figure of a horrified hatchling, tears streaming down like four tiny waterfalls.
————
















Loop after that:
“Hey, uh. I was thinking.” “If the statues are responsible for keeping you aware of the loops, then…”
Hal’s grip on the backrest tightened.
“We tried,” they murmured. “Didn’t work.”
Firn fell silent. Their shoulders stayed squared for a few seconds; then slowly slumped.
“Oh.” Their hands let go of the levers and fell on their lap. “Can I… have a minute?”
“Huh? Uh, sure,” Hal blinked. “It’s… yeah, you took it pretty hard last time too.”
Firn hastily unbuckled and stood up from their seat, walking away from the cockpit. Hal did not turn to look, instead digging their nails into the backrest again, for just a few seconds… before taking a deep sigh, and relaxing them. They needed to move on, Gabbro was still waiting; but also, so what if they were going to arrive late? Gabbro was, well, Gabbro. Even if Firn was about to forget all about it in just a few hours, they were still their best friend.
Hal had also voluntarily refrained from saying that they had died soon after the statue non-pairing fiasco. One heavy non-reveal was enough as it was.
[…]
Hal looked at them with sorrow and gulped guiltily. “You good?”
Firn sat down, seized the levers, then took a deep breath. “…Okay. <span class=smol>Okay.</span> I’m good. Let’s go.”

<wip>(Right after Slate and Firn gag at the sight of a second photo, this time that of Firn’s broken ship on a beach of Giant’s Deep and a dead Hal impaled through the glass.)</wip>
<p>“<i>GEYS</i>—!” Slate gagged before they could finish even that single word.</p>
<p>Mouth agape and trembling, Firn stared and, the same way their best friend evidently had in a different time, it appeared that air was forced out of painfully punctured lungs, by the forces of nature and Hearthian culture alike.</p>
<p>“Hatchling,” the engineer wheezed in panic, “you are <i>messed up</i>.”</p>
<p>They did not respond, whether to deny or confirm. They soon knew exactly why this photo had been taken and saved for their next loop self to find: two short lines of text sat right beneath the morbid surprise.</p>
<p><i>No stunts.</i></p>
<p><i>We <b>promised</b>.</i></p>
<p>The same way showing something physically impossible had been the quickest method to convince them that the laws of physics had indeed been repeatedly broken, Firn knew that showing their own worst nightmare, with <i>tangible proof</i> that it had once been real, was the most efficient way to get the point across.</p>
<p>And the most effective way to make them realize, perhaps for the first time in their whole life, that their actions had consequences.</p>
<p>That their actions could have consequences on others.</p>
<p>“S– Sorry.” Deep breath. “I. I don’t think anyone else was supposed to see this.”</p>
<p>“Like that’s supposed to make me feel better,” Slate sputtered with concern.</p>

Firn *trying* to get paired on Loop 8:
"*Let me at it!*" they screamed, the frequency of their voice dangerously rising, radio saturating with anger. "You piece of *fermented dirt*– LOOK AT ME!" "*Let me go*! If it won't open its eyes, I'll just— I-I'll tear it apart myself and MAKE it!"
Gossan closed their eyes in pain. "Firn… Hornfels had been trying to get Hal's to do that for weeks, without any success."
"Yeah, well– I'm sure Hornfels didn't try it like *THIS*!" (Tries to throw a kick at the statue, only manages to get themself hurt.)
Gabbro: "Buddy… *Firn*. Listen to me. It's… It's not gonna happen."
"*Screw you, Gabbro!*" "We wouldn't *be* here if you hadn't spent all these loops leaving Hal *completely alone* like you've done!" "Ha– ha, we– We wouldn't even be here if you had never *found* that statue to begin with!"
(Gossan took a step forward in warning. "Firn. Don’t.")
(Their eyes full of bubbling rage met the calming waters of their mentor's. Those stern eyes, those three eyes of which they *knew* what had happened to the fourth, knew where fell the responsibility for its absence.
Anger turned to despair, and Firn fell to their knees.)
"Please…" they sobbed. "You can't make me forget again. *You can't!* Not *again!*" "Why did you have to pick them, huh!? Why didn't you pick someone who'd have a *chance* at figuring out what's wrong!"
(Full on sobbing, possibly kicking into a nomai skeleton in rage)
"Hal has been fascinated with your culture and secrets– they've spent *years* off their life trying to figure you out, they had nothing but *respect* for you! And *this* is how you *repay* them!? You *monsters!*"



Gossan, Gabbro and Firn get to see this exchange with a Nomai wall: Shared_GD_StatueIsland_TT_TimeLoopInterior


While Firn is in Porphy’s cabin, Slate comes to visit? But Hal is depressed and asks them to leave them alone.
“Say, uh. I’m not very good at that whole, talking thing, but…”
“Then don’t,” Hal sighed. “…S-sorry, that came out– it’s just…” “It hurts to talk when I know you’re just gonna forget. And if this happens again you’re just gonna— <i>come back</i> again. And I can’t…”
()
“Anything I can do to help somehow?”
“…Make sure everyone leaves me alone.”





Loop 8, after failing to pair: Gossan radioes Hornfels and asks them to give the radio to Hal.

"I'm sorry. Firn and I are going to forget after this." "Hal, you're stronger than you think. You've got Gabbro, and even if it's going to be more difficult— you've still got us when you need it. If the time loop begins when I think it does, then– you know I'll be right here. Even if I likely won't believe you without evidence, and you probably can't afford to drag me to Firn's ship every time… I can still be here for… well. Emotional support, I suppose."
A  pained sigh. "Sorry, I'm just rambling by this point. It's just… There's only one thing I really wanted to say, at the end of the day." "Never forget that no matter what, we'll always love you."

<p class=time>116c 32:13</p>
<p>Firn— or whoever will find this message. <span class=smol>Void, how does this thing work…</span></p>
<p class=time>116c 32:19</p>
<p class=smol>—ait did I turn it— oh, seems like it’s back.</p>
<p><span class=grey>Ahem.</span> This is Gossan. Firn, I hope you won’t mind if I borrow your helmet and leave a message. It’s a very important one, and your current self… is not in a position to do it themself.</p>
<p>—Oh, uh, by which I mean, they’re not <i>injured</i>, don’t worry. They’re just… This morning has just been a lot for all of us, but they’ve been taking it especially hard. Gabbro got them to rest until they feel a bit better, if they ever do before— <span class=smol>Never mind</span>.</p>
<p class=time>116c 32:25</p>
<p>We both went to Giant’s Deep, and with Gabbro, we took a look at those statues in that Nomai workshop.</p>
<p>It’s… Listen. This is difficult to accept, but… Well, heh, maybe just the fact that you will be seeing this and have no clue what I’m talking about— maybe with just that you’ll get the hint.</p>
<p class=time>116c 32:38</p>
<p>We tried to pair with our own statues. It didn’t work. It seems like no matter what we try, Gabbro and Hal are the only ones who will ever be able to remember anything.</p>
<p>Gabbro and I are trying to figure out why the statues worked for them but not us, and it seems to have something to do with the, uh, ‘loop’ at which they found the statues. There was this message between two Nomai on that wall, and they said that the statues will only activate if something worked, or if something broke. Something about the Ash Twin, apparently.</p>
<p class=time>116c 32:52</p>
<p>The <i>Ash Twin Project</i>, right. That’s how they called it. So on that first ‘loop’ where Hal and Gabbro had those statues pair with them, either that Ash Twin Project suceeded in doing whatever it was supposed to do, or it… broke? But it didn’t break again the other times after that?</p>
<p>It seems like the idea that it worked is more likely, but I thought I’d still let you know about the other option. I know you want to be thorough, and you’ll keep insisting on never disregarding any leads till you’ve found good enough reasons to disprove it, so. I’ll leave to you the decision on whether you’ve got good enough reasons to think that— …Well, whatever you’re gonna want to think.</p>
<p>So that’s… Yeah. You’ve got a name, and a ton of questions to sort through. Wish we could’ve found more in that workshop, but it seems like that was it.</p>
<p class=time>116c 34:52</p>
<p>…Listen. I don’t think… I don’t think I will be there the next time around. Maybe not even the time after that, or the… <span class=grey>Ugh.</span> You get the gist.</p>
<p>I wish you weren’t alone with such a massive mountain in your hands, but I don’t know whether Hal will find the strength to deal with me. I don’t know whether they would have the strength to deal with anyone who can’t remember, not in the long run, but. They don’t really have a choice, do they.</p>
<p>The fact that they can’t do much without you… Well, I suppose you should take this as proof that you <i>are</i> ready for your first launch, heh? …Heh.</p>
<p>Take care, Firn, and stay strong. I wish I could do more for all of you.</p>
<p class=time>116c 38:01</p>
<p>…Say, Firn? You have been using an audio recording as proof that you have been forgetting things, and that it really <i>was</i> you keeping track of all these findings. If Hal or Gabbro, or even you– if you ever… Um.</p>
<p>I would be glad if you could show me how to do that next time. Just in case… <span class=grey>Sigh.</span> Just in case you ever need me, you know?</p>
<p>Just… Try to consider that if there’s ever another time when I get in your way.</p>

(First thing Hal does when they come to is hug Gossan out of nowhere.)

Gossan is shocked, but returns the hug warmly.
"Uh… It's okay, Hal. I know you're worried for Firn's launch day, but it's going to be okay, you hear? I've even got them…"
"–the broken mining equipment to fix as practice, yeah."
Gossan's eyes widened in shock. "How did you—"
Hal interrupted their question by squeezing further and burying their head against their shoulder. "Thank you."
(Marl tries to ask what the *heck* is happening, but Gossan sends them a look and subtly shakes their head.)
"Hal," Gossan asked softly with great concern, "do you know what just happened?"
Hal sighed. After a short moment of thinking, they decided to go with: "It's complicated, and I already tried to explain. One time it worked. Most times it didn't."
Gossan frowned. "I don’t follow."
"Hornfels asked you to come down and find me, they told me once. But then we got tangled in a conversation about Firn and Feldspar and the training in the zero-g cave, and I guess you just forgot to tell me about it when we just waved each other goodbye and went on our way."
"Hal, how on Hearth…"
"Time loop. I'll just… I'll just keep it at that. I don’t have time, I probably shouldn't have taken the time now, but…" "I don’t care if you don't believe me now. Thank you for what you said last time. I'll try my best."
()
Marl: "…Should I go fetch Porphy before they get out of your sight?"
Gossan frowned, frozen in place. "I didn't tell *anyone* about the training idea, and there's no way they could have known about Hornfels either. Something else is going on."
"What?" "You don’t think they've just, like… maybe got conked on the head while they were in that spooky statue mode?"

<div class=chp>


<!-- Loop 10/11 probably, when Hal, Firn and Gabbro spend the loop on Giant’s Deep at a campfire and just talk about their experiences. Gabbro tells notably how they lost their ship, then decided to radio Hornfels about it, but instead of finding the courage to tell them that they’d lost their ship, they tried to convince them that they didn’t need another statue. Then they made their hammock and sulked, trying not to think too hard about how much in trouble they were… and then, some unknown amount of time later, probably a bit more than a full sunrise, Gabbro saw a cyclone bring down an island right next to them — almost a meter or two away from crashing into their island, even. And when they looked at it… There it was, a statue laying in the sand. Truly a golden opportunity.
“Thought that was my luck – that in a way, it’d taken pity, yeah, and brought me something even <i>better</i> than giving me my ship back.” “But then… Well. The second I made my way there and got close to it, the statue opened its eyes and did its thing. And then I thought that Hornfels could fish out their own if they wanted it so bad, I <i>needed</i> my hammock.”
-->




<wip>
<p>When Hal finally notices that the reason why Firn is so upset isn’t <i>just</i> because they’re confused. They look considerably more shaken than before, and though Hal is certain that their own behavior is to blame, they finally realize that there is more to it.</p>
<p>“I… I always see you by the computer.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah, but— I’m checking the ship log, you know? There’s not nearly enough time for me to read everything, but. I’m trying.”</p>

<p>In the loop when Hal discovers that Firn has been writing diary-like entries in the ship log, Firn somehow died due to feeling useless compared to Hal and Gabbro. Gabbro convinces Hal to take that time to do some brainstorming, saying that they noticed that Firn kept taking notes whenever they had time alone.</p>

<li><span class=red>Don’t bother trying to link with your own statue.</span> We already tried. Don’t ask Hal about it.

<li>Because yeah, turns out <span class=red>there <i>are</i> other ways to die</span> before the supernova takes you. Wow, it’s almost as if space was like, <i>dangerous</i> or something, who could’ve thought? Voidbrain.</li>

<p>Sooooo we got stranded on the Attlerock. Wanted to try teaching the ropes to Hal just in case one of these loops they get tired of me and want to jump straight to stealing the ship, but they, uh, missed the landing. They also missed the <i>launching</i>, but Hal made me promise I wouldn’t tell anyone about the fact that it was the geyser we crashed into that got us into orbit, instead of the thrusters.<br>Well my name isn’t ‘anyone’ and nobody’s reading those logs anyway. So. Sorry Hal, memory was too funny to let it fade into oblivion.</p>
<p>Thankfully the computer still works, it would have been bad if I couldn’t write this loop’s findings.<br>Not that there’s a lot of <i>findings</i> to begin with, unless you’d like to call ‘Hal now knows this ship has an eject button’ a ‘finding.’</p>
<p>We’ve got a lot of time left before the sun explodes, but Hal said we already explored everything there is to explore about the Nomai ruins here in a few past loops, and with the ship in such a bad state, we won’t be able to move from here. We radioed Gabbro, who convinced Hal to go roast some mallows with Esker.</p>
<p>In the meantime I thought I’d take that time to move the important reports to a new log, instead of keeping all the important info drowned in this mess of… whatever this is. Talking to myself. It’s been a <i>wild</i> trip reading messages left by alternate versions of myself that technically never existed.</p>
<p>Anyway, yeah, there’s a big red <span class=red>“IMPORTANT INFO”</span> button now, you literally can’t miss it. Future me, I know you will forget a lot of things, but I hope you’re not gonna forget how to read.</p>
<p class=time>06d05s 58:51</p>
<p>Aaaaaaand done! There we go, all caught up. Looks WAY less daunting to read that way.</p>
<p>I may go reunite with them, now, if they still have some mallows left.</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 02:47</p>
<p>They don’t have any mallows left. How greedy, the both of them. Told them to leave me in peace with my sulking. They’re better raw anyway.</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 24:43</p>
<p>Hal’s trying to be optimistic, telling me they’re getting used to it, but I can tell they’re terrified in space. Not as much as Riebeck, probably, but that’s still definitely not their element, and Riebeck had <i>tons</i> of training before Gossan let them get anywhere close to even <i>looking</i> at a ship’s controls.</p>
<p>I wonder how it would have gone for me if I’d been the one paired with the statue. It’d suck a lot, but. At least I’m the one with the ship and the training. And the translator. And all the cool gadgets.</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 47:21</p>
<p>The sky is so dark. Is it just me, or are the other stars gone too?</p>

<div class=shiplog><h2>Reading Entry: loop_51.log</h2>
<p class=time>06d06s 29:19</p>
<p>Got stranded in the middle of nowhere. No way back.<br>Told Hal and Gabbro not to bother.</p>
<p>Guess now all that’s left for me to do is see what kills me first: supernova grilling me or oxygen running out?</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 31:42</p>
<p>I’m not completely sure why I’m recording. I’m leaving notes and summaries for Hal’s and everyone’s sake, of course, but that doesn’t explain why I’d spend time leaving, like, my <i>thoughts</i> in here. It feels weird to just write <i>that</i> down, every loop.</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 35:10</p>
<p>I guess, if any future me ponders the same question… I guess it might be because I’d like to… I don’t really know. Be remembered? For this loop to matter?</p>
<p>Heh. How could this loop even matter when I’m stuck here with no fuel and just waiting to die.</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 35:41</p>
<p>Funny how I never noticed how <i>big</i> everything is out there.<br>The supernovae are pretty.</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 35:50</p>
<p>Geyser brambling void of all <i>black holes</i>, I sound like Gabbro.</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 36:03</p>
<p>…Nah, Gabbro probably wouldn’t bother saying any of this out loud. They’d just keep it inside their head and let the thoughts disappear.</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 38:15</p>
<p>I think the Interloper fell into the sun. Just like that. Not even a sound or an explosion or anything. Just went straight into it in silence.<br>Is that how it’s gonna look when it’ll be our turn?</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 41:43</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes left. My mallows are on the oxygen. Might depend on how much I keep talking though.</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 45:14</p>
<p>In just a few moments I’ll be gone too. That’s… I don’t know if I’ll be <i>gone</i> gone, or if it’s just going to be a little part of me that gets erased over and over? But every little part of me that gets erased… because of Hal and Gabbro, they’ve all been different, at least a little.</p>
<p>Each loop, it’s like it’s a slightly different me that dies. Just different enough to not be the same person.</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 48:09</p>
<p>I don’t want to forget. I don’t want to disappear.</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 55:34</p>
<p>I think the sun’s shrinking. Must mean it’s over for me, huh…?</p>
<p>Look at that, oxygen tank managed to lose the race. Yay me, Hal said it was the more painful option.</p>
<p class=time>06d06s 55:43</p>
<p>I’m scared. I don’t want to die.</p>
<p class=time>06d07s 00:17</p>
<p>I’m scared Hal is going to forget me.</p>

<div class=shiplog>
<p class=time></p>
<p>Say, Hal. Ever thought sometimes of just spending a loop or two, like… just taking a break? Grilling a mallow or two, drinking some of Porphy’s “Good” Stuff? I hate it, but you don’t, and it’s about you here, so.</p>
<p>Look, I bet being killed by the sun isn’t fun, but I don’t know if by this point it even matters that much anymore. Maybe “wasting” a loop or two for the sake of taking a break will actually end up with a lower loop count in the long run, if it means you’re all fresh and ready to go in the next ones.</p>
<p>I know, I know. I can’t believe <i>I’m</i> the one pulling a Gabbro right now. But I’m just saying, it really looks like you need it.</p>
</div>



<div class=shiplog>
<p class=time></p>
<p>Past loop me left no catch-up notes. Hal says I died early, though they didn’t tell me how. That’s, uh… something I probably should be mindful of. Turns out there’s other ways to die in space than the sun blowing up on us, haha, who knew? Heh… ouch. Future me, remember to comfort Hal more often. That must be much tougher on them than it is on you. At least I (…we?) only get to live through it once.</p>
</div>





<div class=shiplog>
<p class=time></p>
<p>Hey Hal. Or future me. Or nobody, I don’t think anyone’s reading these anymore.</p>
<p>Got any luck with Gabbro? I hope Gabbro’s not… well, <i>Gabbro</i>. Not too much. I can’t believe they managed to LOSE their ship before the loops started. They’d better figure out its exact location and find a quick way to get to it each time the universe resets.</p>
</div>




<div class=shiplog>
<p class=time></p>
<p>I am. NOT opening the past entries. GEEZ there’s so many of them.</p>
<p>I mean, don’t worry Hal, I’m reading the first ones so I can get the basics without you having to tell me.</p>
<p>…Or at least I <i>would</i> be doing that if you could leave me more than five seconds in front of the computer before dragging me to the front seat and asking me to pilot, that is. You want me to go to DARK BRAMBLE of all places???</p>
<p>I hope this isn’t a loop where we’ll die horribly. I don’t want to think of how many of those you’ve been through.</p>
</div>





<div class=shiplog>
<p class=time></p>
<p>Hal, I don’t know if you ever read these. Maybe you did in the earlier loops. Maybe early loops me didn’t even tell you I’d make those entries too. I mean, I’m pretty sure the original thought was mostly to keep myself up to date, which means saying a lot of things you know by heart at this point.</p>
<p>I… don’t know how reading these would make you feel. I don’t know if I’d like you to keep reading them or not. I don’t know if you should.</p>

<p>“If I were to take your ship, how mad would you be?”</p>
<p>“…Probably way too confused to be mad. Also extremely worried.”</p>
</wip>

<wip>
<p>“Don’t worry Slate, I know what I’m doing!”</p>
<p>When Slate’s aghast and agape face had the displeasure of witnessing their latest creation disgracefully plummet right into the nearest geyser, they gained immediate confirmation that Hal, in fact, very much did not know what they were doing.</p>

# Loop after Gabbro, Hal and Firn discuss Gabbro's attempt at looking "inwards" and seeing their statue's code
Hal stays on TH and goes in the museum to face the Attlerock stone wall in order to try and use its 'glowy pull' as a way to try and find the link to their statue (after having tried and failed to see anything with the statue itself)
(Context: Hal goes to the museum and just sits down in front of the Attlerock wall's writings, trying to meditate in silence while staring at the glow, because it turns out that if they or Gabbro look at something that their Hearthian eyes isn't supposed to see, it's easier to notice the *other thing* that makes those purple and orange lights visible.

A bit later during that loop, Firn first passes by Hornfels (who is completely enthralled by the statue but didn't notice that Hal had sneaked past them), then they find Hal in the museum before they could ask Hornfels for the launch codes, prior to seeing their ship log. They joke about what they're trying to do, but Hal is relaxed, albeit a bit sad, and just goes:)

> "Say. Firn. Come closer." A quick worried glance behind their back, trying to assess whether any noise could be heard from the statue room; then, an insistent nod in their friend's direction. Confused by Hal's incongruous attitude, Firn followed without a word, only growing more surprised when they heard Hal whisper: "Don’t bother with Hornfels, I can give you the launch codes. Only if you do, just do us both a favor, and make sure the first thing you do once up there is look at your ship log. Before you launch or turn anything else on. Deal?"
> Firn frowned. "The ship log's supposed to be empty, how would you…" Their frown deepened. "Marl's roped you and Slate into getting back at me for the [Insert noodle incident] and you're just too nice not to spill the beans, is that it?"
> Hal chuckled. "Guess you'll find out while you're there," they shrugged. "Nothing's gonna blow in your face, that much I can promise. …Well, depending, maybe something will *metaphorically* blow up in your face. But nothing *tangible* is gonna blow up in your face."
> Firn's frown deepened. "You do realize you're not making any sense, right?"
> Hal gave the smallest snort, as some kind of sad and tired chuckle. "Nope, I really am not. Probably will make more sense once you see what's in your ship log though."
> Firn rolled their eyes, standing up. "Alright, fine, you win. We'll see about that."
(Right as Firn is about to leave, Hal grabs their wrist)
> "Sorry, just saying it again for good measure because you might forget once you're there: *Don't bother with Hornfels.* I'd rather they stay wherever they are this time around."
> "…Okay, you're being *very* weird right now. Why are you trying to avoid them so badly?"
> "'Cause I've come here to have some peace and quiet, and if they find out that I'm here when they already saw that the statue's eyes are open, they won't leave me alone until the end of time." Heh. Literally.
(Much later in the loop:)
> Hal opened one eyelid to give them a side glance. "Hey. I expected you would've either come back much sooner or not at all. Unless time's been going much slower than I thought…?"
> Firn took a deep breath through their nose. "No, I've… I've spent the loop mostly radioing Gabbro." A pause. "Supernova's in less than ten minutes."
> Ah.
> Hal opened their other three eyelids and fully tilted their head in their direction. "You need to say something before it goes?"
> Firn's fists clenched alongside their biting lips, as they turned their head to look away. Their face was a blend of many emotions, but with some nostalgically affectionate exasperation, Hal was pretty sure that one of the most prominent was Firn's typical refusal to expose their feelings.
> "I don’t…" Their fists trembled. A sigh. Their eyes remained shut tight and their mouth was turned away, but they gave up trying to play tough when they mumbled awkwardly: "…I don’t want to die alone. Got a spare spot on that floor?"
> Hal's ears dropped, eyes and mouth widening slowly. "Oh. *Oh*. Yeah, I mean– gosh. Of course, come here."
> Shaking all the way, Firn's limbs folded in on themselves as they awkwardly crouched and sat on the ground by their side. They fidgeted for a few instants, until they opted for bringing their legs to their chest and coiling their arms around the whole. Hal snuggled closer and brought their arm around their shoulders.
> "I told Gabbro you were staring at that wall, and they explained that whole… conversation you had last time, about trying to find the statue's code from inside your mind. Or something like that."
> Their eyes turned to meet Hal's. To their relief, they were dry. Relaxed as they were from all that meditation, Hal was not sure they would be quite sturdy enough to handle it if Firn had come to cry in their arms.
> Hal appreciated that their friend would instead go for one last casual conversation, and happily indulged: "Something like that, yeah."
> "Did it work?" A short pause. "Well, just looking at your face I'm gonna assume it did, heh. So uh, let me rephrase: found anything cool in there?"
()
> "…aw geez, I forgot to take my helmet. *Again*."
> "What would you need it for?"
> "Can't write notes in the ship log without it," they sighed. "Already during the campfire thing from last loop, I don’t know how it went, but evidently I didn't leave any notes. I wrote some stuff down based on what Gabbro told me this time so I won't ask about it later."
> Hal's head still tilted to the side in confusion. "So… what?"
> "So that means you're gonna have to say it all over again next time," they sighed with an exasperated grunt.
> Hal's gaze softened. "Maybe. But I'll have to tell Gabbro too, anyway. And it's okay, I know it's not your fault."
> "Doesn’t make it suck any less," they sputtered between their crossed arms.
()
> "This is our first time doing this, right?" Firn asked nervously. "Like. Here. With this conversation. You looked surprised when I came, so– this *is* the first time, right?"
> "Yeah," Hal nodded softly. "First time."
> The ground was getting uncomfortably hot.
> Trying their best to ignore it, Firn's gaze turned away, a small smile slowly digging into their cheek. "Glad I could do something new."
> The supernova took them before Hal could respond.







(Only for loop 9/10+, *after* Firn knows that they can't get in the loop.)

Two minutes after Firn is done reading the ship log and being fully convinced:
"Hal. It took you *forty minutes* to show me the ship log."
"What was I supposed to do, kidnap you and drag you up the elevator??"
"WELL YEAH DUH"
"But that's rude and mean??????"
"HAL."

"What else do you want me to do, kidnap you and drag you all the way to your ship?"
"Well *duh!*"
"But– that's so rude! And mean!"
Firn brought a hand to rub their upper eyes. "Look, you *want* your loops to be long and painful, or you want the hard part to be over quick?"
Hal deflated. "But…"
Firn brought a hand on their shoulder, squeezing hard. "Trust me, I will *thank* you for this. Every second I’ve spent thinking you had somehow conked your head is a second I want to punch right back into my own face. So do me a favor and drag me to this ship log *as fast as you can*, before I can be given any time to say things that will hurt you. Or just become annoying after you’ve heard them for the sixtieth time or whatever." “I– I hate to say it, but I don’t think it’s possible for you to avoid listening to me repeating myself, especially if it’s gonna last a while.” Hal flinched at the thought, forcing their eyes shut with an audible hiss, and Firn gave another squeeze on their shoulder. “But you can try to keep it <i>short</i>.”
“By… By dragging you by force?”
“Yeah. Don’t even give me the time to get a single word in. I can’t repeat myself if you don’t let me talk, can I?”
Hal’s lips trembled as they looked down. "You promise you won’t be mad?"
Firn caught their other shoulder and went in for a hug. "Well, I'll totally be kicking and screaming for a bit. But after that? Yeah. Promise."
()
"I can even help you practice, if you want," Firn assured. "Or, uh, try. There's only so much I can predict about myself, I guess. Real practice will have to be on your next loops."
Hal froze, then blinked with raised eyebrows. “W-what do you mean, ‘practice’?”

Cue the two trying to recreate the scene under Slate's POV, who is just sitting by the campfire and snickering, only to almost choke on their mallow once or twice.



"Come on, I'm not *that* heavy," Firn sighed. "We're practically the same size."
"Would've been much easier with *Chert*," Hal moaned.
"Heh, for sure. Maybe try running a bit faster. Remember–"
"–Momentum, conservation of energy, kinetic to potential, I know," Hal grumbled. "Doesn't make it any easier."
"You're holding back, that's why," Firn sighed with a roll of their upper eyes. "Don’t stop."
"But what if I…"
"You can't know if you don’t *try*, can you?" "You've got infinite tries. You've *died* before, I've died before, we're all dying again at the end of this. So *don't hold back*."

Firn, still folded into a ball of limbs by the campfire, trembled in rage. They soon pushed themself up and away from the log they were sitting on in a single jump, and completed their landing by kicking their can of mallows right into the fire, along with a cry of rage.
Their best friend cowered again and buried their head in their shoulders, still sobbing. "F-Firn…"
"It's just gonna come back later," they grumbled carelessly.
Hal looked down. "I-<span class=scaps>i</span>'m sorry…"
"No, *I'm* sorry!" Firn shouted, before they instantly slammed their mouth shut and bit their lips, attempting to contain their voice and tremors. "None of this is your fault. We shouldn't *have* to be doing this. You shouldn’t *have* to be facing a brambling *voidhead* like me every time you start a loop."
Hal shuddered. "You're not…"
"*Forty **minutes***, Hal! I've been looking at you like you were insane for *forty* [brambling] *minutes*, and doing everything to keep you *away* from my ship! While the only thing I should've been doing is *help you* get in there *faster!*"
(…) "It's not your fault either if you can't remember."
"You think I *care?* That doesn't change the result. I've been nothing but a pain to deal with, and— and I don’t know how to change that–"
Slate gave them a deadpan look. "Think scaring them off from trying to talk to you altogether is going to help?"
Yet another roar of rage was caught inside their throat. "What am I supposed to *do*, Slate? Let them endure all this all over again!?"
()
"Is there… If I can't get them to the ship log, i-is there any way I could get the ship log to them instead?" Hal pleaded quietly. "I-i think their helmet is connected to it, right? So what if I run to the ship to take it and then show it to you, and…"
"No. You can only check the ship log from inside the ship," Firn grumbled.
"You can write in it from anywhere, but I never thought anyone would ever need to *read* it from anywhere," Slate sighed. "Figured that when Firn would be up there and out of their ship, they'd be busier looking for hazards around them than checking their notes."
Hal's ears deflated. Slowly trying to accept their predicament, but no less terrified of it, they let their head lower to the ground and their legs fold to their chest. Slate brought an arm to cover their back and gently pull them to their side.










For a couple of loops, it would actually start with Gabbro radioing Slate right from the beginning?
For no reason in particular, Slate’s radio sprang to life. “Hey, Slate?”
“What the– Gabbro?”
“You should take Firn to their ship, there’s something up there you both need to see.”
Slate frowned. “I don’t know the–”
“Dash-dash dash-dot-dot dash-dot. Now you know them.”
A shocked blink. “Gabbro, how on Hearth–”
“–did you know that because Hornfels changes the launch codes for every new astronaut and they would never give them to anyone until Firn’s launch day and I’ve been on Giant’s Deep for the past two weeks. Yup, still am,” Slate opened their mouth to try and voice their next question, only to be interrupted again when Gabbro continued, “and now how oh how was I able to finish your sentence before you, you ponder,” Slate’s jaw hung open when they once again recognized the very question they were about to ask, except phrased with a condescending tone that was extremely unfitting of the astronaut they thought they knew, “that’s a mystery that Firn’s ship *might* answer for you, why else do you think I started with that? I hope you didn’t already forget, even though I can imagine how much the fact I’ve been somehow able to predict everything you were about to say is getting on your nerves.” The shipwright frowned, opening their mouth— “And yes, I am totally getting a kick out of this every few loops or so, maybe one out of five. I can’t see your face, but that one moment when you’re trying to catch up but you’re out of words so it just sounds like you’re blowing a raspberry never gets old.”
“My-Pbth—!?”
“Yup, that one.”
Firn stared at the receiver in shock, then exchanged a freaked out look with the engineer, but before either could speak, they were interrupted by the sound of footsteps running their way.
Hal arrived wearing a spacesuit, helmet in hand, and stared at the two Hearthians on the ground. Then they frowned.
Walking to Slate, they crossed their arms and grumbled directly into the radio: “Gabbro, what is the point of you contacting them early if they’re still down here when I arrive?”
“…Oh. Whoops. Time flies. You sure got faster at getting the suit, huh. Good job. You managed to outrun Gossan this time?”
Hal brought a gloved hand to rub their upper eyes. “They’re *right behind me*, Gabbro, they’re gonna be here in just a few—”
“Hal, what on *Hearth* do you think you’re doing!?”
The linguist gave an annoyed grunt. “—seconds.”
Firn finally succeeded in coming up with a new sentence. “Okay, uh, I have *no idea* what’s going on, so could you and Gabbro run that down by us again?”
“Yeah, Gabbro, why didn’t you run that down by them while I was on my way?” Hal sighed. “I thought the plan was to get them *already* convinced by the time I’d get here, with the best timing being Slate taking the elevator back down and Firn already in the pilot’s seat.”
(When Hal would arrive with the zero-g cave suit, Slate and Firn are still discussing up there, which is why it would be faster for Hal to just grab Firn without explanation? Either that or Gabbro also gets tired of the script. They may decide to take it in turns?)






Hal: "…You’ve been leaving notes to yourself."
Firn replied with a sly grin. “Maybe.”
“But how? I don’t see you by the computer <i>that</i> often.”
“All thanks to the suit, mostly. It’s directly connected to the ship, so I can write log entries from literally anywhere, anytime. Really gotta thank Slate for making the connection work through the radio. The speech-to-text part was all me, but I still gotta hand the rest to them. Turn off the radio, press record, start talking, turn the radio back on when you’re done, and it’ll send the entry to the ship.”
Hal frowned. “Why turn off the radio?”
“‘Cause I don’t want others eavesdropping, <i>duh</i>.”
“But that means you’re not listening when you do it…” “…and <i>that’s</i> why sometimes it felt like you were zoning out.”
“Yeah, probably. That’s… to be expected. Sorry for that.”




Gabbro, already standing and watching them land with their gear ready, gave a solemn nod.
Firn making a scrapbook of sorts in their ship log, taking various photos of Hal in space:

"Hal finally discovers the joys of zero-g!"
"oh shit they noticed shit shIT SHIT"

Loop maybe 10-12:
Firn: "So… What you’re saying is that we’re stuck in a time loop."
Hal sighed. "Yeah. Everyone’s forgetting everything at the end of it, including you."
Firn: "...........Have I tried throwing Tuff in the zero-g cave yet?"
"What!? Why would you want to do that!?"
"Because they'll forget?"
"You will forget too, voidbrain!"
"But I can take pictures!"







VISION-POWERED NOMAI TECH DOES NOT WORK WITH NON-PAIRED HEARTHIANS.
The Nomai operated that technology with their third eye, an eye which Hearthians do not have. Hearthians paired with statues become able to because of their link to their statues' equivalent. Describe a feeling like having their inner sight being tugged away, similarly to the pull of the statue once had, but much more fleeting and inconsequential.

(Hal activates the sphere, seeing it light up.) They gasped in swift shock, bracing themself for what almost felt like another *'spiritual experience with a rock'* (albeit, this time, not shaped like a face); yet, aside from this first fleeting instant of intrusiveness with the feeling of something tugging away at their inner sight and stealing the attention given to it before converting it into a bright purplish light, nothing fundamentally consequential seemed to happen.
Firn placed a hand on their shoulder. "Hal, you good? It looks like you saw— whoa!"
By the time their sentence was almost finished, Hal had moved their eyes to meet Firn's, on their way to explaining what had just occurred, and to pondering why they had not noticed the sphere's obvious change in color and brightness. However, Firn's yelp had interrupted them before they could proceed with either topic.
"What in Youngbark's geysers– Did you *see* that!?" Firn cried out. "It just moved on its own!"
Hal turned back to the wall, and saw that the sphere had, first off, lost their color, and second, been left somewhere in the middle of the rails, still having barely some momentum left— and never mind that, the exact second Hal's attention was once again focused on it, the sphere lit up again, tugging away from Hal's mind with that same intrusive feeling *again*, and as they staggered back without daring to look away this time, they distinctly saw that the sphere's movements were reflecting those of their own eyes, even through the thickness of their visor.
They were staring at the ball; and somehow, the ball was staring back.
"It… looks like it can be operated by looking at it," they mused with another gasp, this time filled with awe. "That would align with some technical texts Riebeck once brought…"
"*Wow*," Firn exclaimed in an impressed mutter. "We've *never* seen any of those things in action on Timber Hearth, that's for sure. Slate would've added that to every ship they could if we'd ever found a working one." Soon, however, their expression turned to confusion and doubt, as theirs shoulders tensed at once.
Oblivious to this last fact, Hal nodded, both nervous and giddy at the novelty which was yet, somehow, distantly familiar in a rather uncomfortable way. "Well, maybe the ones on Timber Hearth are broken? But evidently this one still works," they shrugged with a smile, caring not to let their eyes wander too close to that specific spot on the mechanism. Turning to their best friend, they took a step back and raised an amused, inviting hand: "Wanna give it a try?"
Firn paused. It was difficult to know what they were looking at or looking like, due to the visor obscuring their face; but one observation which could be unanimously made, was the fact that the sphere remained unlit and motionless.
Hal blinked, briefly looking at the door only to startle as they saw the ball react to *their* observation instead, and to immediately force their eyes shut. They pursed their lips awkwardly. "You, uh, have to–"
"Hal, I *am* looking at it. I've been *staring* at that thing for the past two minutes while we were talking. I don’t think 'looking at it' is what triggers it, honestly."
"What? No, I swear that's…" Hal turned to the sphere– a single glance, a foreign tug and the feeling of seeing their status as an observer temporarily returned right back to them and mingled with that of the observed, and the sphere was glowing and moving.
"You've gotta be joking," Firn grunted while glaring at the mechanism. "Sure you haven't found a secret lever you're pulling when I'm not looking?"
"Firn," Hal sighed exasperatedly with a roll of their eyes, "you know I'm not *you*."
Both hatchlings startled when the sphere lit up on its own and was operated once again.
Then it dimmed and went still, and a third figure appeared between them. "Seems like it's a Firn issue," Gabbro stated calmly. "It really does follow my eyes."
Hal looked at their best friend with worry. "W-what are you talking about? What does that mean?"
"Beats me," Gabbro shrugged. "Maybe that's another statue thing."
If Hal's ears were not compressed by the tight space of their helmet, they would be flattened to the extent of touching the ground. "That's… not fair."
Firn's fists were shaking, but they remained silent for very, very long seconds.
"Guess you might as well try and see if the ones on Timber Hearth are *really* broken, then," they eventually spoke in an annoyed whisper. "…in another loop. Yay to me being locked out of *another* cool thing. Again."
"But why would being able to *open a door* be related to being stuck in a time loop? That's ridiculous," Hal frowned.
"*Convoluted*," Gabbro opted for correcting. "Who knows, maybe the Nomai were living in a time loop the whole time."
"…I'm not gonna try to pretend I can even remotely have a clue what that might have looked like and how much I'm pretty sure that makes zero sense," Firn sighed. "They disappeared *eventually*, after all, so time loop from eons ago or not, that didn't last."
(Hal keeps trying to figure it out as they move on, and eventually:)
Hal stopped, gasping. "The third eye."
Both astronauts stopped, turning around and staring in surprise. Firn piped up: "What?"
"Multiple texts seemed to imply that the Nomai's third eye was, well, *different* from the other two, somehow. What if it's because of that third eye that they could operate the vision mechanisms?"
Firn and Gabbro paused, exchanging a glance. Firn crossed their arms. "Nice theory, but I didn't see you or Gabbro with a new eye hole on your foreheads."
Hal remained silent, instead looking at Gabbro expectantly.
"You… you know what I'm talking about, right?" "The feeling of– of *being* observed? Like, constantly, ever since the loops started?"
Gabbro's stance shifted uncomfortably. They took a deep breath. Then, turning to Firn, they found the words to summarize the conclusion that both had just deduced: "We don't have Nomai eyes, no. But the *statues* have one. Maybe all three of them count, even, who knows." They pulled their eyes back to their companion in misfortune, then added: "Methinks we are observing things, and the statues are observing what *we* are observing. Which sort of makes it count like we're looking at things with a Nomai eye somewhere in our heads, or however that works."
Firn squinted. "You're saying you're being… spied on? Through your own eyes?"
"By a computer statue thingy," Gabbro nodded with a shrug. "Yep. *Something* is sending us memories of what we did every loop. Must mean they're being recorded somehow before that. Which must mean the recording's taking notes right now, probably."
(Silence.)
"I guess that explains why nobody ever figured out those mechanisms before," Hal whispered.





When Gabbro explains around a campfire on Giant's Deep(?) that they tried meditating and looking through the metaphorical statue's eyes:
"It's easy to get lost, but the good news is that the statue seems to want to help us. So if it realizes we're lost and want to get out, it's going to kick us out."





Firn sat down at their log, picking up their marshmallow stick and pretending to roast a delicacy that wasn’t there. “Okay, Hal. Ready?”
Hal stared at them from the other side of the clearing, standing upright and rigid like a stake. They nervously but purposefully shook their head. “Nuh-uh.”
“Too bad, ‘cause time’s ticking. You already wasted twelve seconds.”
Hal’s hands closed into shaking fists, lips trembling. “Don’t count the time, it’s stressing me out.”
“Sixteen,” they insisted with a sly grin.
“<i>Firn!</i>”
“<i>Seventeen.</i>”
“Urgh— F-<i>fine</i>, fine!” they shouted while throwing their hands in the air, before trotting in their direction and grabbing their arm, trying to pull up. “This is ridiculous.”
“It won’t be in two sunrises,” the cadet reminded coldly. “Use your momentum, don’t stop when you get to me. And be faster, you gotta watch out for Slate as well.”
Hal’s eyebrows twitched as they raised two pairs of trembling eyes to the Hearthian in question. The engineer swallowed the marshmallow they were greedily enjoying while watching the scene, then sent them an amused wave. “Don’t mind me, I’m leaving you on easy mode for this loop.”
Hal let yet another exasperated grunt resonate within their throat.
[…]
One of Hal’s attempts at pulling Firn up will get their legs tangled in their log and get them injured, and Hal will cry out.
Hal gasped, letting go instantly to instead bring both hands to their mouth and clutch their face in horror. “S-sorry! Sorry– o-oh geez, I’m so sorry, are you—”
Firn grumbled in pain. “Just continue.”
“W-what!?”
“Continue!” they repeated with more insistence. “It’s just a scratch!”
“B-but what if—”
“Time is <i>ticking</i>, Hal!”
Slate put their stick down and stood up. “Firn, I think that’s enough.”
“The time loop doesn’t <i>care</i> if that’s enough!” they roared. “Get back down. Hal, let’s do it again. From the beginning.”
Unmoving, the founder frowned, sending the two a worried glance. “Hal…”
“<i>I can’t!</i>” Hal screamed.
Slate’s lips pressed into a thin line.
“I-I can’t…”
Firn lowered their head to the ground, gritting their teeth. Their arms went to wrap their knees as they let their chin rest on top.
“I can’t have that happen to you again,” they whispered. “It’s— You’ve been through <i>this</i> like, what– five times by now?”
“T-they weren’t as bad as the ones in the observatory,” Hal assured with a nervous smile.
“I don’t <i>care</i> if they’re not as bad,” Firn grunted, “they’re still <i>bad!</i> And they’ll just get worse and <i>worse</i> the more loops you go through! And I’ll be the cause of it, and I can’t do <i>anything</i> about it!”
[…]
“Please. Please try it,” Firn whispered in a broken voice. “I don’t want to hurt you more than I already have.”







As soon as they both jumped down and landed on the beach, footsteps came to meet them. Gabbro.
“Time Buddy,” they greeted Hal. Then, turning to Firn, they gave another, more hesitant nod. “…Buddy.”
The ears of the buddy in question flicked nervously as they looked down and pressed their lips together.
“Sucks to be jostled around and confused, we know. Totally my bad for losing my ship,” they added with genuine intent, but abnormally quick and distant tone. The tone of rehearsal.
Hal rolled their eyes, confirming Firn’s suspicion. “Gabbro, no offense, but you’ve used this exact phrasing at <i>least</i> four times,” they exhaled. “Do you really have to?”
“Hey, still gotta be polite,” they shrugged. Turning to Firn, they added: “Don’t worry, it’s not that they don’t think you deserve an apology. It’s just that—”
“—that it sucks to hear your friends repeat the same thing over and over, so since <i>you</i> have the ability not to it hurts them to hear you repeat yourself,” Firn completed in a tense mumble.
The elder astronaut noticeably stepped back just a bit, and were their visor not so opaque, Firn could have seen that their exorbitant eyes just doubled in size. “Whoa, how did you…”
“Figured that out on the way here,” they shrugged heavily.
“Buddy. I don’t know how you do it, but you’re a lot more perceptive than I gave you credit for. I’ll keep that in mind for the next ones.”
Again, Firn’s only answer was a hesitant, somewhat trembling shrug. “I’ve, uh… got my ways. Can’t say it’s nearly as effective as I wish it could though.”
They frowned. “Ship log?”
Firn replied with a raised eyebrow, then a nod.
“Got to see how you use it on my first loop, and Hal told me it can remember somehow. Turns out Slate’s spoiling you with your fancy equipment really is [a godsend].”
“Yeah.” A pause. “Wish I’d thanked them for it while I had the chance. I feel like a jerk.”
“So do we for ruining your launch day,” Gabbro shrugged heavily.
Firn simply sent a short hum. Turning away and towards the pilot’s seat, they added with a tint of urgency and sorrow: “Come on, Hal’s waiting.”



Firn offers Hal to spend a few loops without them.
"You know, if you need space—like, <i>personal</i> space, not <i>space</i> space—I can…" "I can just write down for the next few me’s to not bother you."


The first time Hal and Firn make it into the Ash Twin Project, Hal has a moment of near panic attack upon realizing just how vulnerable seeing their memory in physical form (the masks) and seeing that one of them is broken makes them feel. Firn relates with that since their memory is pretty much also stored in physical form on the ship log.
Firn will want to try and see if they could possibly tinker with the masks/statue and force one to pair with them? Regardless of whether their attempt is successful or not, this would be pretty much the end of the line anyway, and after they found the sun station. So maybe you can afford to finally have them reunite in the end.

Ship Log:

• "That's... starting to be a lot of loops, huh. Won’t be long before one of the future me's will give up and not even start reading.
• "Oh geez. Past loops me left a lot of messages, didn’t they. I don’t think I'll have time to read them to catch up."
• "Oh geez. Past loops me left a lot of messages, didn’t they. I don’t think I'll have time to read them to catch up.
...Stars above I just glanced at last loop's entry and I just said the exact same thing word for word. How can I stop this!?
I can't afford to fall behind. For Hal and Gabbro, for me, for everyone.
They need the ship and the translator. They can’t have those if I can't *keep track* and pull my own weight.
Future me's, no matter what you do in the next loops, KEEP READING THESE NOTES. I'M WRITING THEM FOR A REASON."
• "[...] I, uh, hope I didn’t say that already, haha. Sorry if I did."
• "[...] ...I hope I didn’t say that already."
• "If I really leave a message every single loop, this is the 57th. That’s... that's a lot. Wow.
Say, you know, if one of these loops you just went in and scooped up the ship while I'm off to getting the codes from Hornfels, I won't mind. I mean, I *will* mind, obviously, I'll be super worried and confused, but. You get what I mean. You have this loop me's permission.
I was about to say "I hope I didn’t say that already," but given the amount of entries there's no way I never said *that* already."
• "Assuming I wrote a message like this every loop, this seems to be the 72th...? Geysers. By this point I wonder if you might as well be more efficient piloting the ship yourself.
I hope you're not getting too tired of hearing me saying the same things over and over. I wish I could avoid that."
• "There's no time to read what I said in the past loops. There's so many entries.
I don’t know if I ever took the time to do that back when there was a reasonable amount. I hope I did at least early on. Hopefully that would have helped for some time. I bet I'm just boring and predictable now.
I'm sorry. I'm making you waste so much time. I'm so sorry."
• (Repeat that last entry a few times in a row with little to no variation.)





“We don’t talk about loop [63].” (loop where Nomai probe hit Firn’s ship and they and Hal argued very badly due to Hal and Gabbro not having any evidence to prove they’re in a time loop, no ship to go anywhere, and no tools to do anything with because they were either destroyed by the probe or in Firn’s hands.)




“Knowing me, I’m sure I’d be insufferable without those ship logs,” Firn shrugged heavily. “It hurts to say, but. I wasn’t believing a single word you were saying until I saw those, and the only reason I played along until that point was because you said you had tangible evidence. No offense, it’s just… It’s just that this whole thing is too crazy to just… you know.”
“To be fair, I don’t think I’d believe you either.”
“Well, yeah, but at least in my case you’d have a <i>reasonable enough</i> excuse to assume I’d just be pulling your leg and dumb enough to pull it off. In your case, that’s… That’d be more of a Marl thing.” “So, uh. Unless it’s a loop where you don’t need me, please make sure I get to read those as soon as possible.”

[Probably between Firn and Gabbro, rather than Firn and Hal.]
A sigh. “Look. It’s not that I’m jealous or anything, but…” “Alright, maybe I’m jealous. It’s just… Why did that statue choose <i>you</i> rather than, like, anyone else? If the Nomai wanted someone to do something, then it just… It would’ve made so much more sense to pick an actual astronaut.”
“You would’ve wanted to be picked? It’s… it’s not fun, being in the loops. You don’t realize how many times I’ve seen or heard the others just… do the same thing on repeat.”
“I can imagine that.” “And… I just didn’t want <i>you</i> to be the one who has to go through it.”
“‘Cause you wanted to be the one.”
“It’s not like that!” “It’s just… I feel useless, okay? And I hate it. I can’t <i>tell</i> how long it’ll be until I stop being helpful, and just become a chore instead.”






"Hal, did… something happen last loop?"
(No answer for a while.)
"How?" The volume was so low, Firn pondered whether they had said anything at all. But then, it came again, ever so slightly louder: "How are you doing this?"
"Doing what? Holding up? I'm not the one who has to go through it over and over—"
"And that's the thing!" (They instantly calm down.) "You don’t *act* like it. How can you start up fresh and without any memory each loop, and yet…"
Firn crossed their arms proudly, giving a smug look. "Not get boring?"
"Yeah. Not asking questions. Staying unpredictable. You're predictable for like five minutes, and then— I only have to tell you the same few words each time, like three lines, and after that you're…"
They shrugged, as if it were obvious. "I read the ship log, buddy. Simple as that."
"The ship log doesn't have *nearly* enough information to let you do that!" () "…Does… does it?"
()
"…You've been leaving notes for yourself every loop."
"Yup."
"Where? How did I never—"
"Never bothered to look, maybe?" they shrugged. "Though to be fair, past me's put those behind a password. They got a bit personal after a while."
()
"And you just– You just… *guess* that you'd be leaving yourself notes? How?"
"Well, if we assume that part of the exchanges we have that are you just repeating the same thing and me answering the same way keeps going until you leave me to read the ship log… You told me the statues are the reason you and Gabbro remember, and I just remembered that my ship was built out of a chunk of yours. So I just went, 'Surely I would have tried it, right?' and, yep, turns out I did. Neat, huh?"
()
"What kind of… what have you been writing to yourself for it to work that well?"
All at once, Firn's smug expression melted immediately, leaving behind tight lips and slightly trembling fingers. "Hal, it's behind a password for a reason."
They raised an eyebrow at that. "What, leaving an embarrassing fact about yourself you're the only one to know about as proof that the time loop thing is real and it's really past you talking to yourself?"
Their only answer was a heavy shrug, followed by: "Everyone's got their secrets. I'd like to keep mine if you don’t mind."

One loop, when Firn is about to die after they had a very serious and emotionally heavy loop… they would reveal the password to Hal?
Or maybe it's less than a minute before the Sun engulfs the Sun station, after they both learned that it isn't responsible for the sun going supernova.
"Will you even remember me after this?"
"What sort of question—" () "Firn, what are you talking about?"
"The me from each loop. You can't remember all of them anymore, by this point. There's been so many—too many already. They've been blurring into each other, haven't they?"
(Hal wants to disagree, but can't find words.)
"What did loop 38 me do?"
"We've stopped keeping–" (Hal stops, realizing that the fact alone they and Gabbro stopped counting the loops only further proves Firn's point.)
Firn's lips trembled. "[Sap wine sucks]."
Hal blinked. "What?"
"If– if you need. If you want—" Another cough. "It’s [Sap wine sucks]."


Firn's entry when they add a password:
[  ] Uh, it's been getting a bit too private in there. I think it's better to hide this behind a password if I'm gonna be this brutally honest with myself.
[  ] Also, Hal was on the rather… scary side this time around. They must be getting tired of going through the same script or however they've surely decided to call it by now. Thirty-ish loops sounds like a lot. Hopefully having this password be something so random would be proof enough for future me's that they're not fooling around and that they need me to be (operative) as fast as possible.
[  ] This is start of loop me, so I hope other start of loop me's will get the same idea. It seems to have worked pretty well so far. Start of loops are gonna be nearly identical so far anyway, at least in what I'm looking at.
[  ] Okay. Password, password…
[  ] …Porphy’s still preparing their "good stuff." Ugh.
[  ] Well. If there is one thing I'm sure every future version of me will agree with, it's that sap wine sucks.
[v] No matter how much everyone else'll disagree, sap wine sucks. But at least you'll agree future me, won't you? Of course you do. You're gonna see them every time you're standing here, at the start of every loop, looking at the exact same scene time and time again.


Password-protected ship logs have two logs: one with the extra personal stuff, and the other one which is the first one Hal sees:
"Rules for loop #615:"
And a condensed bullet list of "Don’t ask Hal about X" and "Does Y do Z? Yes." ending with "Plan: Explore A, look for B in particular."
- Rule 0: Update the loop number first. Current number is for last loop.
- Rule 1: Don’t be hard on Hal. You've got less than four hours before the sun explodes and they have to deal with your memory getting wiped all over again.
- 1.bis: If you want to say something, think first about how likely you are to have already said it in a past loop. Questions about the current loop plan are relatively safe, even if you've asked them before they probably haven't heard those enough times to get tired of it yet.
- 1.ter: If you ask a question and Hal looks *noticeably* annoyed, you know you've fallen into a pattern. Write it down here so you don’t do it again.
- Rule 2: Don't question what they say about the Nomai or the time loop, or anything really. They have no time to fool around, and even if they're just taking a loop break to prank you for some reason, it'll be over soon and you won't even remember it.
-2.bis: If this line is still here, it means Hal never took a loop break to prank you. You're safe.
- 2.ter: If this line is still here and they look tired or at a loss this loop, try to convince them to take a break. It's been way too many loops and they haven't taken one for as far as this log exists.
[…]
- Turns out Gabbro *can* be helpful. Don’t ask about their ship. Don’t sass. You've sassed enough in the past loops, whatever you might think is something you definitely said before.
[…]
- #12: No, there is no loop where you got to see Tuff in the zero-g cave, and yes, stop trying. Hal’s run out of “dialogue” to deter you from it, and they’ve got all your movements predicted to the millimeter (and trust me, that’s creepier than Dark Bramble and you do NOT want to see it). From their own words, you’ve seriously started to sound as obsessed with this plan as Marl is with that tree. In our defense, we probably wouldn’t if we could remember. Still, now you know why this rule exists.
-12.bis: <s>Maybe you can try getting Spinel to reel in their own hat?</s>
-12.ter: Scratch that, you’ve become too predictable on this one too. Just don’t try pranks, Hal’s gotten really tired of trying to stop you. And really REALLY good at being creepy on purpose when doing it. The only one getting pranked when you try it is you, because Hal’s going to start finishing your own sentences and answering your questions before you can ask them. And the worst is when they start pushing rocks right in the middle of every footstep you’re about to take with the precision of a computer, then you know you’ve got them on a bad mood and REALLY should just drop it.
(PS: The rocks thing doesn’t hurt because of course they’re just nice like that. It’s just REALLY really freaky because they are NOT telling you that they know your movements down to the position of your feet to the millimeter. They just let you find out little by little and grin at you in a ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about’ way when you start noticing.)
[…]
- Added #364: Sun Station isn’t responsible for anything. The universe is dying. There's no saving anything.
- Added #364: I gave Hal the password. I'm sorry.
This part of the ship log is likely shaped similar to the in-game ship log, without the arrows? Or at least there's one big red sentence, and the rest in smaller text as details.




So there are loops going:
"So, Ember Twin?"
Hal startled. "Wait, did I tell you where we were going?"
Firn just gave them a smug shrug as they pulled the thrusters and launched off. "Latest entries on the ship log are all about it. I trust you already know where the sand and ghost matter are gonna be? Even if we'll end up dying anyway, I, uh, think I'd rather pick the supernova over either of those."
Hal blinked repeatedly, struggling to follow the fast pace of their locution. "A-are those even mentioned in the ship log—?"
"I'll need you to point me to the best spot to land." Firn was now fully turned towards them, casually resting an arm on the (dossier) of the pilot seat and the other against their (hanche), leaving the controls to the ship's computer alone. "I can't remember anything, remember?"
Hal buried their eyes inside their hands and took a deep deadpan breath. "Alright, now you’re just messing with me on purpose."
Firn's grin expanded. "Maybe."
Giving a defeated huff, Hal shook their head and looked past the cockpit, at the vastness of space… or rather, at a slowly but surely growing sphere of fire. "…You might wanna mind the autopilot."
Looking back at the controls, Firn instantly lost their confidence and flared the thrusters back as they barely managed to escape from the sun's strong pull, stiffling various creative swears aimed at Slate all the while. Once the threat fully avoided, they took a few dozen seconds to steady their hands and breath, then muttered sheepishly: "I, uh… Yeah, I'll really need you to point me the way, though. From my perspective, it *is* my first time in space."
Hal kept their lips tight for a moment, averting their gaze. No more words were exchanged until Ember Twin appeared close enough to land on.



Hal’s reaction to seeing Solanum:
Hal’s jaw dropped to the ground. In fact, they were currently not looking at the Quantum Moon’s ground, so who knew, maybe it even dropped past the ground and came out all the way to the other side of it.



"Promise me you’ll take some loops just to have some sleep, 'kay? Even if the loops start in the morning, I bet your mind still needs some rest."
"What, you suggest I just stay in bed till the supernova? What about you?" "What if they're loops where you… don't update the count? I thought that was important for you."
"Don't worry about it, I'll figure something out. Leave myself a message. I'll probably go to Hornfels to fetch the launch codes and only notice the ship log halfway through the loop or something, but I'll make sure the first thing I see when I do is the same as what I saw this time — and, uh, probably every time. As well as a message to not tell Hornfels about it."

<!-- @SFOLD STRANGER -->
<!-- .
(about the Strangers’ language)
"This is *fascinating*. Their entire culture revolves around light and dark, down to their writing! It took me forever to figure out that it's not just the writing that has meaning, but also the empty space *between* their glyphs! For so long I thought the additional dots and waves were meant to be little more than small alterations, but no, they define entire new words!"

While Hal is figuring out the Strangers’ language, Gabbro and Firn investigate… and talk about time loop stuff.

[While they are inside the simulation(?), or in a place where Firn can't access their ship log easily, Gabbro basically makes as little effort as possible to break patterns, so Firn repeats themself a lot and Gabbro doesn't stop them. Firn finds out soon enough and gets frustrated every time.]
Firn could not quite put their finger on it, but something felt… off. Maybe it was just Gabbro being Gabbro — from their own perspective, they had not seen each other in weeks, and they had never been close anyway. But their ship log claimed that they had changed quite a lot due to their time in the loops, so maybe their nonchalance and distant responses were caused by… something else.
They frowned warily. "…Gabbro, be honest with me. Have we had this conversation before?"
Gabbro answered immediately, without any surprise or the slightest sign of wavering in their tone. "Fifth time, I think." Not even a blink.
()
"Why don't you just lie to me, then? If you're gonna play with me you might as well pretend you never heard me say that before!"
"Would you like me to?"
"Wh—Of course not!"
"Then it's not the point."
"What is, then?"
"Trying to have you *relax*." "This is your first launch—" they silently tutted Firn when they tried to correct them, "—your *first launch*, buddy, and you've just learned about a whole new alien species with a spaceship the size of a whole planet. Have a good time. Enjoy the view. Keep all that insane catching up work for some other loop."
"And how am I supposed to enjoy *anything* when I know some other me has already done it all before? *Multiple* of them!?" "And the way you talk, your questions– Are you even *trying* to convince me of whatever point you're trying to make, or are you just repeating the same thing too just to keep me stuck in a pattern!?"
"Well, it was more like trying to delay the moment you'd realize until as late as possible. I tried everything I could think of. Neither idea worked."
"Neither idea," Firn deadpanned. "*Fifth* attempt."
"I'm not very creative, sorry."
"Say that to your quantum poem."
()
"It's *fine*, buddy. Hal isn't here all loop. You don’t have to worry about being predictable when they won't even notice. Just take it easy, will ya?"
"It's not about Hal! It's about– about— You can't just leave me like this!"
Fists curling and uncurling, they looked to the left, to the right– If Gabbro wasn’t about to break the pattern, then *someone* had to, *somehow*. Now what was the most un-Firnesque thing to do—
(Gabbro catches them and says that they already tried X and that it did not end well.) Firn scowled and then fell to their knees, screaming in rage.
“Every loop we’ve met, you’ve been wracking your brain in ways I didn’t even know were possible, and in ways I don’t think anyone ever <i>should</i>.”


"You really wish you were in the loop, huh?"
"*Duh!* What, do you wish you weren’t?"
Judging from Gabbro's dubitative expression as they diverted their gaze, Firn hoped that this meant this was their first time asking this one last question. Thank the *stars*, no thanks to Gabbro, they had finally managed to break the pattern.
"… a very good question. I might need a few dozen loops to ponder about the pros and cons."
"Loops you wouldn’t *have* if you weren’t in," Firn deadpanned.



Gabbro discusses the matter of whether it is a good thing or not to keep the whole universe in limbo, with everyone dying repeatedly. Firn is by far preferring that to making their death permanent, but the fact that they can’t remember the loops is giving their words less weight. Firn then argues that even though it's taking a while, Hal is working hard and as fast as they can, and that they know they are not dragging things on purpose.
"Hal’s work looks good on their bucket list," Gabbro nodded, "but what change is it going to make? They’re not doing it because it’s gonna save anyone. It’s a distraction so they don’t have to think about the fact that they can’t."






What to call the Stranger’s inhabitants without using “Owlk”?
antlers?
soft scales?
————————————
"They have antlers, and those strange, soft scales… 'Antscales'?"
"They look nothing like ants. No thanks."
————————————
"How about the 'Two-Eyed'? A bit simple and straightforward, but…"
"Somehow, that makes them sound ominous. Rather fitting if you ask me."
————————————
"If we decided to call the ship the 'Stranger', maybe we might as well stick to 'Strangers', no?"










The first time Hal and Firn investigate the Stranger:

“Stars above, I could spend an <i>eternity</i> in here!”
Firn sighed dejectedly. “If only the sun weren’t exploding in just an hour or two.”
At first, Hal sighed dejectedly with a disappointed nod; but then, the reality of their situation dawned on them. A tiny shy smile, then an ever expanding grin, then a mesmerized epiphany, crawled up on their face. Stars in all four eyes, they turned to their friend in one swift move and grabbed their shoulders, arms trembling with excitement.
“Firn, I <i>have</i> an eternity! I have all the time in the universe to learn their language!” Firn tried to nod, though most of their head’s tilting was caused by the fact that Hal was shaking them like a [pine tree]. “I can’t believe I’m saying this— For once the time loop is a <i>good</i> thing!?”
Hal slowly stopped once they saw Firn’s expression shift, turning calm with a happy bittersweet smile.
“What?”
“Heh, nothing, don’t worry about it. I’m just glad to see you so excited. I was wondering how many loops it could’ve been since you last were this happy.”

Loop right after the first time they found the Stranger:

Ship log:
Note from Loop #[42], leave it up until it becomes obsolete: Don’t freak out about the number of loops growing rapidly without much (visible) progress being done. We found an alien ship that isn’t like anything we’ve ever seen before, and Hal is going to try cracking their language. You know how long it took to decipher the Nomai, so without the loops it would take them months, if not a few years. So yeah, don’t be surprised if we end up spending a hundred loops or two with just Hal locking themself up in a dusty attic scavenging for old books.
Just make sure they’re having fun, and if they are, leave them to it. It’s cool. It’s progress, and they’ve been ecstatic over the idea of spending however many loops it will take them, so it’s <i>good</i> progress.
Feel free to explore on your own in the meantime, that ship is HUGE. It’s also weird that we haven’t found anyone yet, dead or alive… You should investigate that.








"Task Failed Successfully" and "Good at seeing what could be improved in Hindsight" are Gabbro's specialties. So is "did not think this through" in the sense that they did take a little while to ponder their options, but they do not go in depth into thinking about the consequences.



in the scene (after some chatting) it's Gabbro going "you two hatchlings go to sleep, I'll be back real quick" and then when Gabbro joins them in the simulation, Hal literally didn't notice anything (which was pretty much the point of "go to sleep first")

I had disregarded oxygen deprivation as a whole because of the fact that there is oxygen inside the Stranger and the fact that you couldn't empty your O2 tank if you wanted to


Basically the plan they end up with is "the least traumatizing outcome is if someone is killed while they're already sleeping inside the simulation and the one committing the deed is not a hatchling forced to murder their best friend" so. Firn and Hal are standing inside the simulation, chatting for a bit, then Gabbro shows up after a few minutes:

> The elder astronaut turned to Hal. "Feel any different?"
> Firn's eyes widened. Hal kept their silence.
> "I didn’t even notice," they eventually mumbled, a trembling smile creeping up their face.
> Gabbro nodded. "Good. Must be for the better."

Then, once it's time to blow the seal:

> The moment Hal turned around and made their way out of the room, Firn took a sharp breath. "…You do realize we're both getting kicked out the moment they get there, right?"
> Gabbro's long silence soon conveyed the answer that they had, in fact, completely forgotten this detail. "…Correct."
> Firn's hands trembled. "I hope you kept it clean."
> "…I went to doze off at the next campfire."
> "You *wHAT*—"

Ask Gabbro to come up with clever ideas of offing their friend for a loop
Gonna end up with blunt trauma probably
Why did my mind picture Gabbro finding a way to detach the alarm bells and drop them cartoon piano style, only to then realize that if they could detach them, then perhaps they could have avoided the "offing their friend(s)" bit. The main reason why I am ruling this one off alongside "deliberate reactor failure" and similar explosions is because they don't want to take the risk of damaging the artifacts and pyre. But I can write it as one of Gabbro's suggestions only for Firn to retort that "uh yeah but then there is no need to kill anyone"

Only one person would need to cross the noisy bridge to extinguish the seal, right?
And technically speaking, I think Gabbro offing Hal in their sleep is less traumatizing to them than Gabbro trying to off themself awake or asking one of the two hatchlings to kill them



When Firn and Gabbro are woken up by the alarm, we are under Gabbro's POV with Firn soon rushing out of their pyre room screaming. The state of Hal's body is left to the audience's imagination.
~~Only issue is that I *think* Gabbro has very realistic reasons to not want to tell Firn which pyre they went to afterwards~~
what reasons are those
~~Firn going a little bit feral~~
ok checks out. I don't think I'd want to be on the receiving end of a "traumatised Firn" tirade
If we go with "blunt trauma", "didn't think things through", "would rather not answer the question 'I hope you kept it clean'" and "forgot Firn would wake up to this", uh……. yeah. yeah totally a tirade
in Gabbro's defense, their initial intent was to take that secret to their grave and never have Firn see it either

I'm going with "blunt trauma", "didn't think things through", "would rather not answer the question 'I hope you kept it clean'" and "forgot Firn would wake up to this", so…
whole thing made funnier(???)/so much worse if they go back into the simulation after the bells go out again (if they go out?) to meet with Hal and Gabbro tries to stop Firn from mentioning in what state Hal's body was left as

like Firn regularly having nervous moments of "Is your eye okay?" / "My eye?" / "Yeah, like– it doesn't hurt?" / "Firn, I'm supposed to be dead right now. Nothing hurts." / "Yeah but the…" (seems to gesture something like a massive hole in the middle of the entire face, to Hal's confusion, until Gabbro gently lowers Firn's hand with a whispered "shhhhhhhh")
"Gabbro. What did you do to my body?"
"Nothing that won't be undone by the time you reunite with it next loop. Don't think about it."
"*Gabbro.*"
Firn crossed their arms as an attempt not to shudder. "I can tell you what I saw if you want me to, but…" Their sentence trailed off uncomfortably as their mouth twisted into disgust. They felt relief at the realization that throwing up their breakfast was likely an impossibility within the bounds of the simulation.
Gabbro did not take the risk of Firn trying to speak again, as they joined their hands together right under their nose and took a deep inhale. "Oxygen tanks give a lot more momentum than you expect, I forgot the one-point-three-g factor, and my hand slipped. Again, *don't think about it*. At least it did the job, you didn't feel a thing, and *none of it is permanent*."

Hal asking for details: "Okay, please, I need to know. Just how bad is it?"
Firn, deadpan: "So you see Dark Bramble and that story Chert says about it every time you so much as look at it?"
Gabbro, swiftly interrupting before Firn can say anything else: "I meant to give *one* good whack that would put you out quickly and as painlessly as possible—"
Firn, continuing: "—yeah except it looks more like you got confused between a scout launcher and their frontal lobe."
Hal, after a good half minute of just staring in shock and 'cannot compute how absurd this entire situation is': "You know what, I'm not even mad."



On the Stranger, inside the simulation: Firn purposefully hides their lantern in a hidden corner, then they're the scout with 100% visibility while Hal and Gabbro conceal their lanterns and just hang on to them. That is, until Firn trips on something that wasn't visible because of the deloading zone not rendering it or something

<!-- .
Loop where the probe crashes into the ship:

Skin paling to a concerning grey from below their scales, Firn first found themselves paralyzed. Then, all their muscles were freed at once.
"*My ship!*" they shrieked out in alarm, running to the edge of the launching pad and almost falling over.
"That… that never happened before," Hal muttered in a frozen, breathless whisper.
Firn eyed them. "Uh-huh. Time loop, and something that never happened before. Totally adds up, Hal."
"N-no, you don’t get it—"

"Your ship logs! Here, if you'll just take a look at your sh—"
"You mean what's left of it," Firn sputtered with venom.

[When they look at the probe]
"It's of Nomai origin, no doubt about it. But what's it doing here…?"
()
Hal gasped in realization.
"It fires in a different direction each loop! The probe cannon— *That's* what they meant by only having to fire once!? And then—" Panting from the weight of their deductions, which they now thought they could have already figured out so, *so* long ago, they needed a moment to just gather their thoughts and tread this path again. Confirming that their reasoning had to be true, they staggered to their feet. "I— I-I have to find Gabbro."
Rushing away, they were momentarily stopped by Firn, who had grabbed their arm.
(…)
"Hal? Didn’t you say the plan this loop was to take off?"
Firn's eyebrows twitched at that. These two had never been close before, and they were positive they could not possibly have had any time to agree on any sort of 'plan.' Against their better judgement, they were still reluctant to accept something as ludicrous as whatever list of surreal events their morning had brought them, but…
Hal had failed to notice, too busy bringing a hand to the back of their neck and rubbing it awkwardly.
"Yeah, uh, about that… We're sort of grounded."
A snort, followed by some laughter, instantly resonated out of the receiver.
"For lack of experience or for medical reasons? Heh, probably both by this point."
Hal deadpanned. "Try 'Nomai probe decided to hit Firn's ship'."
()
"Welp, nap time for me then. See you next loop."
"*Gabbro.*"
"What do you want me to do without any ship?" "Just go have some quality time with the others, alright? At least you're not stranded alone."
()
"…So that time loop thing… It really is serious, huh?"
()
"Hal, why won’t you talk to me?"
"I can't do that every single time, Firn!"
()
Why were they being so much more obnoxious this time around? Sure, the frustration of losing their ship had to be factored in on top of their usual (upset-ness) at the start of every loop, but normally, by this point they would already be trusting them fully and following their directions with no objections. Why was this time so different? (Answer: because this is the first loop in a few dozens where Firn has zero access to the ship log.)
"Usually you're not that difficult," Hal muttered, too low for even they to notice that their lips had shaped the words.
"Just like *usually* I have my ship, huh?" And yet, somehow, Firn had heard it. Hal covered their mouth guiltily, turning away and not looking back.
(…)
Hal: "What is *up* with you this loop!? Usually you're never this… this…"
"This what? Skeptical? Sane?" they asked in exasperation. "Rational just like everyone else on this planet?"
"Obnoxiously predictable!"
Just as these words came out of their mouth, Hal suddenly froze. Finally, they realized.
It was not this loop. In actuality, they should have understood so much sooner that something had been up with Firn, indeed, but that this loop was supposed to be the only one that made sense.
Their behavior in every single loop before this one had been the anomaly.
Firn was unable to remember the loops. And yet, somehow, they had managed to remain mostly unpredictable… How? Because they and Gabbro were constantly bringing them into new places, always giving them new sights and events to react to? No, even then… There were so many lines they could have been repeating at the beginning of each loop. So many questions that they had asked in one loop, but never on the subsequent ones. The more loops went on, the more… complacent they had been. The least resistance they had showed to being asked to go through positively insane situations. The more they had even shrugged off the possibility of dying, just accepting the knowledge that they would be back in just a few hours, even boasting that, contrary to their two time traveler friends, they had at least the chance of not having to remember dying.
Somehow, Firn had no memory. And yet, they had evolved just like a real time buddy would.
This time loop's Firn was the only one who behaved like a memory-less Firn should; and the thought that *this* outcome—that losing a friend's trust and respect altogether in a matter of minutes, over and over and over again, never to be believed, only to face a wall of empty lines and predictability—was supposed to be the only normal one… This thought was so much more terrifying than any planet in the entire solar system could be.



Loop where the probe destroys the ship:
Hal, trying to find evidence to convince Firn that they are in a time loop: "What about… the launch codes? Don’t you think it's weird I already knew them?"
"You could've easily gotten them from Hornfels just by looking around."

Gabbro asking if Hal got grounded for medical reasons:
Hal snorted humorlessly. "Try Nomai probe destroying the ship."
Hornfels: "…Why would we ground *you* for medical reasons?"
Hal sent them a deadpan look. "You do *not* want me to answer that question."
Gabbro: "Wait, what Nomai probe? The one from the orbital station?"
"That one," they nodded. "It seems like we never realized it, but… I think the direction it fires is actually *different* each loop."
"How's that possible, though?" "Ooh. Unless…"
"Unless its firing in every direction *is the whole point* of the time loop. Yeah."


Loop where probe destroys ship: Hal flees into the quantum grove and finds Gabbro's poem.
Firn doesn’t get to find Hal when the loop is about to end and they see the sun growing larger and redder. Maybe they don't realize at all though.

<!-- @EFOLD -->
<!-- @SFOLD Core of Giant’s Deep -->
<!-- .
When they get to the core of Giant’s Deep and see that the Eye was found on loop #xxx and that they are on loop #yyy:


"It's just one loop…? I don't get it."
"No, you don’t," they nodded gravely, look stern and cold. "That's the thing, Hal, that's not just one loop. That's the last three hours of my life, and by [the stars-forsaken *anglergish*], I want them to *matter*."





Slowly, gradually, all four of Firn’s eyelids squinted, as their mouth pursed into a leery frown.
Finally, after a quick shake of their head, they muttered under their breath: “The count’s off.”
This is because Firn never knew about the loop where the ship was destroyed by the probe, and therefore did not know that they had not updated the loop number on that one.
Hal blinked in surprise. "What count? You've been counting the loops yourself?"
"Wh- Of <i>course</i> I have, haven't you? This was supposed to be the [xx]th. Or rather, I <i>thought</i> this was the [xx]th, until I saw this."
"How do you even keep track of the loops? Do you just…"
"-manually write down the loop number when writing in the ship log? Well, <i>duh</i>. I already have to start from scratch each loop, how else do you expect me to come anywhere close to staying on track when it's so hard to catch up?"
"I just… didn't think you would ever <i>need</i> to do that? I get writing down what the last few loops were about and our objectives, but what does knowing which loop we're in do that's of any use?"

“If the loop when the Eye was found was the same one when you and Gabbro got paired with the statues, then we should be on loop nine million – et cetera – and twenty-six. Why is it saying twenty-<i>seven</i>?”
Hal stared at them in confusion and disbelief. “What does it matter? They’re both <i>terrifyingly</i> huge numbers, one more or one less by this point— I especially don’t understand why it’d get <i>you</i> so worked up–”

(By this point, Hal realized that Firn had stopped listening, instead glaring down to the side and evidently thinking at high speed.)
"Hal. Was there at any point a loop where I never got to update the ship log and you never told me about it?"
()
“<i>Hal</i>,” they insisted with more urgency, “has there been a loop you’ve <i>hidden</i> from me?”
“What!? No!” “What would that even— there’s been <i>so many</i>, you can’t possibly be keeping track anyway, there’s not enough <i>time</i> for you to learn about all the times we’ve– I don’t know, tried to force a gooey mallow into the anglerfish’s mouth at the museum, or—” “Firn, I know not being able to remember is upsetting, but <i>what</i> is the issue here? What makes you think I’d <i>want</i> you to forget things on <i>purpose?</i> What sort of thing could that even…”
(Hal freezes, as slow realization dawns on them.)
Firn’s fists clenched shut. “So there <i>is</i> one,” they muttered with venom.
()
"…Only one, the probe had destroyed your ship at the very start of the loop-"
(Firn muttering to themself "Maybe I can still fix this…")
"- But I swear I wasn’t <i>hiding</i> it or anything, I was just so upset and I didn’t know-"
"How many loops ago was it?"
"I— I don’t know! That was while I was learning about the Stranger’s language, we’ve spent <i>hundreds</i> of loops there! There’s no way to…" “…Gosh. I’m… I-<span class=scaps>i</span>’m sorry.”
(pause. Hal is surprised to see Firn positively upset.)
"Why didn't you tell me?"
"I- Because I never tell you about the past loops? You've always caught up all by yourself with your own notes."
"Nothing of value happened there since we were stuck in the village, I don't see why you're making it that big of a deal. That loop didn't matter-"
"It matters to <i>me</i>, Hal! You have told me this happened!"
"You have <i>tonnes</i> of secrets of your own! Why shouldn't <i>I</i> ask you about all that secret info you've hidden behind a password?"
"Because it's all that I have!"
(…)
"I <i>know</i> I'll be forgetting everything soon. Why do you think <i>I'm</i> keeping track of everything? I can't even trust my own memory! If- if I can't trust the fact that <i>everything</i> is in there, how can I trust <i>anything?</i> For all I know, someone might as well be tampering with the logs and I'm just following blindly things that I didn't even write!" "You wanna know what the password is for? I'm putting <i>everything</i> in there- both a short and long version, all the time, I'm literally putting my <i>brain</i> into my ship. And I can't let you see that, because if you read it- what's gonna be left of me? I'll just become like the others, boring and predictable- Don't give me that look, I <i>know</i> you've been thinking that, I know that's why you're always avoiding the village. I just… I want to stay relevant. I want to- I want to be able to <i>be</i> your friend, someone you know but also someone who won't be <i>predictable</i>. <i>That's</i> what the password is for, Hal."
(…)
"Hal. <i>What happened</i> on that loop?"
"…I lost my best friend."
(Supernova is going soon?)
Firn looked up, trembled, turned to them with two pairs of eyes filled with the pain of betrayal.
“Oh yeah? Well, if you don’t want to lose them again—” (Hal flinched) “—next loop, you’ll tell me what happened.”
// "If we’re still friends—" (Hal flinched) "—next loop, you’ll tell me what happened."




Loop after that, Hal explains and apologizes:
"I'm sorry. I swear I wasn’t– I just hadn’t realized how much it mattered to you. Or understood *why* it mattered to you."
“Yeah, I-I guess… Look, I still need some time to <i>process</i> what even is happening, but– If I understand how it’s been for you, I’m sure it’d make sense for you to think the way you have.” They looked away. “…and it’d make sense that I wouldn’t tell you I don’t feel the same. Totally a <i>me</i> thing.”
"I'm… I'm going to die," they muttered. "You and Gabbro– you're going to die and come back. But me and everyone else? I'm going to *die* die. For real. Again and again. I don’t *know* if next loop me will be *me*. I have none of the memories– I don’t feel like I'm the same person as the previous me's. I read the latest ship logs– I talk to myself like I'm talking to someone else. Most of it is just giving instructions. Telling future me's what to do, and what not to do. Sometimes it says why. Most times it doesn't. It also says not to ask. Not enough time."
()
"I think that's why I've been counting the loops. It's how many times another me has died. A me that was different from the last one, and won't be the same as the next one." "…or at least, that's what I've been telling myself. It's when next loop me becomes the exact same as current loop me that it'll stop having a point." "Is that selfish…?"

"You're… always overthinking everything that way?"
"When I can't ask questions, it's the only thing I have."
"You don’t have to put that much pressure on yourself, you're already amazing just the way you are!"
"Hal. I know you *wish* it could be that way. I do too. But isn't that one loop you told me about exactly *proof* that I'm really not?" "You still don't get it? I can't tell how many loops it's been unless I read the logs. I can't *tell* what questions I could have asked hundreds of times, or things I would have said on multiple loops, unless I left notes with answers and instructions. How'd the loop start, again? I bet you've had the script optimized by now. So when does the script *end?* How many minutes do you have to relive each time before I *finally* stop being obnoxious?"
()
"You’re gonna get tired of me eventually," they asserted, and before Hal could object, they shook their head. "I'm not mad. You don’t have to be mad at yourself for it. It’s already natural to grow bored and annoyed when it's [Spinel retelling the exact same story each campfire over and over], I can't even begin to imagine how much torture it is when the whole *universe* is stuck on repeat like that." "How hard is it to be with the others back in the village? Is it hard to even, like, just *be* in the crater? Do you know everyone's schedule by now or something?"
"N-not to *that* point, I've never stayed in the village for nearly long enough to remember that." (Looking down.) "Though I'm…" "…trying not to think of Hornfels. Or Marl, and (), and () too I guess— …but mostly Hornfels. It just… hurts."
"So you're gonna get tired of me, too." (Hal sends them a look about to break down, terrified.) "We both wish it weren’t the case, but it's really a question of *when*, not *if*. And if the 'when' is still an unknown variable — If it's the *only* thing I have *any* sort of control on… I've just been working on delaying that when for as many loops as I could."
"And you've been amazing at it," Hal heaved.
Firn gave a small, slow nod. "Thanks. I'm just upset I can't keep at it forever. It's been tough, there keeps getting more and more stuff to read each loop. I'm scared one of these I'll just… no longer have the time to read any of it. Or like, important parts of it." "…heh. You think it'd look as if I had dementia or something? Like one loop I'm fine, and starting from the next one I start *mysteriously* 'losing' some core memories from your early loops?"
["Memories you never had." Because they were not the same Firn.]
(Maybe even getting tired of Gabbro eventually.)
"What core memories? Did anything from the first loops still matter that much now? —I-I mean, *you* matter, and– it's– it's just that if *you* don't always remember them– What kind of memory would be so important that you'd *need* to relearn them every single time?"
"You really don't know?" (Silence. Faltering smile.) "…Good. Guess that means I'm good at my job, then."
"What…?"
"The observatory."
Oh. *Those* early loops.
"I only have notes starting from loop six, of course. But those are enough. They're enough for me to know that whatever I do, I *can't* have you go through that again. Not for as long as I can."
()
"Six loops were enough to break you once. It's been [] loops since then. I don’t know how many more you'll have to go through before we find a solution." "The day I become predictable through and through, it's over. I *can't* let that happen."
"And how many loops will it be before *you* break!?" Hal cried out.
(Silence. Slowly, horror dawns on their face. Firn's ghost of a tired smile creaks up, distant and shy.)
"None. Guess that's the perks of not getting to remember." "I only have to hold on for a couple hours. It's tough but doable. And if it means you're not suffering as much, and we're making progress towards *finally* getting rid of that problem, it's worth it." ("It's in everyone's interest that I make those count.")

———————

"I think I found it."
"Found what?"
"The hole. The part where there could've been a missing loop."

Ship log:
——————
Start of loop #xxx.
Hal looks… upset by something. Like, <i>really</i> upset. Last loop's logs ended at around one hour into the loop, so I assume we may have both died? (at least me?) Apparently we were in [Dark Bramble… Yeah, I guess death by anglerfish isn't pleasant.] / [that thing called the “Stranger”? I’m not sure what kind of dangers it has, but I guess there must be unpleasant ways to die in there.]
…Either that or I was the only one dying and they had to deal with my corpse the rest of the loop? Yikes. Yeah, that might be it. They’re looking at me like I’m the problem. So, uh, note to self: try not to die early this time around.
——————

"Go on." "Write down what you want. Take the time you need."
"Thanks."

——————
Start of loop #xxx — except, uh, this is Firn from loop #yyy speaking.
This loop wasn’t documented until now for the very simple reason that I didn’t even get to have my hands on the ship log AT ALL, or even the ship altogether for that matter.
That loop brought back bad memories of the observatory
Hal told me about it, I'm choosing to trust them. The only reason they took this long was because they didn't realize it was important, not because they didn't want to hide it. Or, well, they sort of did hide it, but like, not on purpose. It's like how they won't tell us how dying on Ember Twin feels like, 'cause it just *hurts* and that's that.
It hurt to hear it. I'm mad at loop #xxx me, and I'm sure every future loop me who has the ability to read this will agree.
PS: We're cool. Future me, don't take it too hard on them, they had their reasons and they just legit didn't know we had any reason to want to know. They understand now. I made them promise that they'll always tell me about that kind of thing in the future, and I think they will keep it.



Ship log of loop right after Nomai probe hit the ship:
(During that loop Hal doesn't get Gabbro and instead got straight to the Stranger.)
—
(Time)
Hal looks… Geysers. They won't leave me the time to read the previous logs, they barely even let me read the "Important notes" one before they just asked me if I was convinced of the time loop yet. Had to turn on the autopilot to that alien ship before they'd let me continue reading. They said I'd have the whole loop to read and write anything I want while we'd be there.
Is that what the loops did to them? This is just… Hearth. They look so *mad* and *lonely*. And if any of what they went through is anything like what I *think* I'm piecing together from those notes… Yeah. Yeah, that is BRUTAL.
I'd give them a hug if I weren't 99% certain I already did that hundreds of times before and it's just gotten dull too.
(Time)
They're looking at me like I'm the problem. I'm scared to ask. I'm scared of HAL, could you believe that!?
They said that every start of loop is rough and that I just can't help it if they're upset at me for becoming predictable and dull. They said it's their fault for making me do the exact same thing every loop for the sake of getting to the Stranger as fast as possible and that I shouldn't beat myself up for it. That they can totally make me do something different if they want me to be *me*. Whatever that's supposed to mean.
They took it back right after, so. I just don't think they were thinking clearly.
Anyway. Not my fault. But also my fault. Ouch.
They said burying themself in the Stranger's library is going to make them feel better. I hope they're right.

(Hal looks devastated, shaking.)
"Did I– did I really look *that* bad…?"
Firn shrugged heavily. "No way to check. I sure couldn't tell you. But…" () "Look, it wasn’t, like, completely your fault or anything."
"It *was*! I treated you horribly that loop!"
"And I'm just glad to see you still care about it," Firn cut in gravely, looking away.
"We all have our bad days, and your bad day has been a [skyrocketingly] bad day. You can't be strong every single time. And that one time I…" "I gave up on you when you needed me the most, there's no other way I can put it, and if I could face them right now, they would be eating some punching in the fact for breakfast. It's okay if you got mad at me because of it. Even if it was the next me, not the me that really hurt you."
()
"If it happens again… I don’t know, if there's another meteorite that destroys the ship *again* before I can be convinced, it's okay to just avoid me and wait for the next one."
()
"You… *waited* for the next one. Right?"
"I… Y-yeah. I couldn’t…" Pause. Shudder. Sharp breath.
Firn's eyes trembled. "But you tried it?"
"I stole the zero-g cave suit, got to the quantum grove, tried to radio Gabbro only to find out that I broke the aerial at some point, p-probably when Gossan caught me and I had to fight them off. // stayed on the radio with Gabbro for a bit. Then others found our frequency so I had to turn it off and run again. // I got tired of running, fell into the geyser tunnels on the North pole… and started thinking that I just didn't want to spend the rest of the loop alone. I couldn’t do *anything* except running and hiding. And even when I got the good hiding spot, well…"
"Hal. Did you *try?*" Firn asked again, softly. No anger. Just sorrow.
They gulped. "All the ways I thought of were going to be long and painful though. So I just… didn't make any choices. As I usually do."

————
Next loop:
Barely a minute after liftoff, the radio crackled, soon followed by Gabbro uttering a single word: "Hal?"
The Hearthian in question blinked in surprise. "Uh, hi Gabbro. Yeah?"
"You didn't get me last time. Did something happen?"
()
"…Stars. Sorry, totally my fault. I completely forgot to pick you up."
"Mhm. You were gonna forget this time too?"
Their ears twitched before drooping. "…Sorry."
"Nah, you're good. Last loop was a nice nap for me, and I could've had another this time too. Just wanted to check and make sure you were okay."
Hal sighed in relief. "Yeah. Yeah, I am. Last loop was good, I finally figured out some patterns for where the verbs are supposed to be."
Sound of a tongue clicking. "Nice. Great for you."
()
"…Didn't answer me though. Where's your ship headed now?"
"Oh–! Uh. Oops."
Firn saw their best friend lose every remaining speck of confidence and badassery they still had and replace it with a face purple with shame, and thus thought they might attempt to be helpful by speaking in their stead. "The HUD says the, uh, ‘Stranger’? It’s about fifteen kilometers away."
Gabbro gave a humming sound again. "So you're already almost there. No need to change your route now then, don't worry about me."
The pilot frowned. "I still don't see anything, though."
"Give it a minute or two," they answered with a knowing laugh. "You will soon enough."

————
The way they manage to trick the ATP into activating the statues is Hal collecting the data from the probe that found the Eye, copying it, and sending it right back to the ATP instead of the data the ATP would expect to get from the OPC.
Gabbro frowned. They clicked their tongue before speaking, trying to continue thinking as they were saying it: "The statues are only supposed to activate on the loop where the probe finds the Eye, right?"
"Either when it finds it or if something goes wrong," Hal nodded.
Gabbro paused. Hesitated, keeping their question for just a little bit longer, for fear that sharing it could be a bad idea. And then, they asked.
"What if it found it again?"
————
"Okay, Hal, you're giggling to yourself," Firn teased with a grin. "What do those spirals mean?"
"Those <i>spirals</i>," Hal responded with mock offense, "are the data that the Ash Twin Project collected on loop nine million, three hundred eighteen thousand and fifty four, my friend."
It took a few seconds for the revelation to click; a few too many, as Hal jumped to their feet and grabbed their shoulders with far too much force, all the while squealing in frequencies Firn was not even certain a signalscope could pick up.
"I <i>found</i> it, Firn! I found the line that tells the whole solar system to activate the statues!"
————




After they get to force the ATP statue to pair with Firn, then Firn definitely had a couple loops where Gabbro, and to some extent Hal (with translating), slowly learn how the machinery works, and whether or not it is possible to trigger it.
If they succeed, they might consider pulling others into the loop as well in order to plan an evacuation to the Stranger… and eventually use it to go to the Eye.
Who would they pull in? The travelers, Chert and Riebeck, or the founders? Perhaps the founders, as despite the lack of ship, they do have the authority.
Seven masks are available, if they figure out how to disable the now useless OPC and have someone else pair with it instead.
Slate, Gossan, Hornfels.

"Slate's easy," Firn stated with a cheeky look at the engineer. "We both start right by the launch tower, and showing you the ship log is only a matter of implying that <i>something</i> messed with your invention while you weren't looking."
"And when the loops start, Gossan is right next to me," Hal smiled while sending the Hearthian in question. "

Slate snickered. "Us two stuck in the same ship without Hornfels to mitigate? That sure is a plan doomed to failure."
Hal deadpanned. "<i>Surely</i> you two can behave for just one or two sunrises when the <i>entire universe</i> is at stake. Right?"

(maybe you do actually pair Gossan and Slate at the same time in the sun station?)




Before they start any permanent tinkering with the ATP, there are 3 active Nomai masks (Hal, Gabbro, OPC), 1 broken, 4 inactive.

Finding the statues:
• 2 at Sun station (for Slate & Hornfels)
• 1 in Statue Workshop? (or more for fic purposes, but there aren't going to be more masks…?)
• 1 in Black Hole Forge
• 1 in ATP (for Firn)
• Re-pairing the one inside Giant's Deep's core?

Loop after they managed to get the ATP statue to pair with Firn: Hal reaches the camp, Firn turns to them.
"We did it," they breathed, as if afraid that saying it too loud would remind the universe that they had cheated, and convince it to correct this mistake. "Hal, we– we did it!"
Slate raised an eyebrow, ready to ask what they were talking about; but decided against it when they saw Hal shake while repressing an audible sob, and then the two hatchlings running to each other, falling into a trembling embrace.
"Oh stars, I can't believe– How much do you remember?"
"Only the loop where you got the statue to stare at me, but that's progress!" "Geez, I have *so* much to catch up on."
"What if it only works– n-no, I shouldn’t…"
"Let's go back and make sure. As long as the mask's glowing again, I– There's no reason it shouldn't be fine." "Let's radio Gabbro too, shall we?"
()
"Not to butt in, but whatever nonsense are you two talking about?"
The two friends turned to face Slate, then shared a glance, then turned back just as unsure. "Right. Last loop you just" "But, hey– if it *really* works, what's stopping us from getting them too?"
Hal raised an eyebrow. "The fact that we only have seven masks in total and that being stuck in the loops is *not* fun?"
Firn's enthusiasm melted off their face. "Right." Firn felt the uncomfortable thought that they had yet to die — or rather *remember dying* — a single time, and that their turn to experience it might come sooner than they would be prepared for it.
"We need to be sure of what to do," Hal asserted gravely. "We can't bring everyone in. And it wouldn't be right to force them into it without asking first."
(Slate crosses their arms and asserts their presence, asking again for answers.)
"Sorry, Slate. Maybe later."



(Firn can't see the lights prior to being paired. Inside the ATP, they will be confused when Hal is mesmerized by the flow of information near the end of the loop.)
Hal's ears dropped in worry. "You… you don’t see them?"
Firn frowned in confusion, turning their head in various haphazard directions before coming back to face them with disappointment. "See what?'
"The lights," "they're purple, just like the glowing masks, and they're being taken out of them and to somewhere else,"
Firn's mouth opened ever so slightly in silent shock. "Hal. None of the masks are glowing."
() "How did you think I knew which ones are active, then?"
"Because you speak Nomai? I just assumed you were reading the signs." "Well, that and the fact that you could've been here before, but. That's your first time in here, right?"
Hal nodded shakily. "I've– I've seen those masks in projection pools before, and they were already glowing back then. I don’t understand."
() "Those lights… you think that's the information those Nomai computers have?"
"I assume so?"
"Then maybe you can see them because you're a part of it," they hypothesized. Then, with a short and sad breath, they lowered their head. "And I can't because… I'm not."



[Everyone expresses immense relief when they notice the previously dark mask turn on again. A few moments later, Firn radioes to tell everyone that the pairing was successful, and right in time because Firn got the alarm that the sun had exploded and the supernova was getting close. Does Firn joke about getting to die for the first time, and is cut short before the end of their sentence?]





—

Whatever loop where they decide to take action and get the founders:
Hal grabs Gossan's arm.
"Gossan, I need you to go to the launch tower. It's an emergency."
(Gossan stares at Hal's sudden change in demeanor compared to how they were prior to freezing in place, and is therefore unconvinced.)
Gossan squints with suspicion. "Did Firn rope you into one of their pranks again?"
Hal's ears twitched and faltered for a split second; but after a moment of quick thinking, they decided they might as well go along with it. "What if they did? Slate's already there, and I'm supposed to bring Hornfels too. At least if you go there, you might warn them that something's coming."
Gossan's suspicion turned to wary confusion. "Hal, at least when you get involved, you're *usually* an (involuntary complice). Your attitude got me worried sick for a whole minute, and now… What is it that you know?"
"I'm sorry, but the best way to find out is to go there. I can't just tell you, you *have* to see it. So do Slate and Hornfels. That's why I have to go fetch them too."
()
"Please meet up at the launch tower. I promise I'll be quick."

—

Slate is the first to agree to getting paired with a statue, within just a dozen seconds or so, and Gossan ponders out loud whether they would just use it to try out new inventions, and that there isn't much time for tinkering or building anything from scratch. Slate doesn't reply, simply giving a look with a raised eyebrow and remaining still and silent, unfazed.

Gabbro: "Hornfels, you're ground control and closest to the comms by a long shot. You get to tell the travelers what to do anytime and they'll question you the least about the whys. It's your choice, of course, but… your help would be invaluable here. Strategically speaking, your being with us would be a huge breakthrough."
"Not to say that either of you aren't worth it, of course. Just… circumstance. Hornfels is just closest to the comms, and it's literally their job to monitor them."
(Firn discreetly turns to Gossan, not daring to say anything but giving them a sad and apprehensive look. They did not intend to make it visible, and they were discreet, but Gossan noticed. Gossan in turn has their stern expression melt ever so slightly, ears flicking for but a split second, before they return a single subtle nod.)
"We can't leave them alone with a [problem this big]," Gossan asserted gravely, attempting not to be patronizing, but to show their support instead. "It would require some attempts, but I may even be able to get a ship ready within ten to twenty minutes. It would be far easier for transport already, if we all need to get here again."
Hal perked up at that. "Another pilot would be nice," they blurted out, only to press their lips together and glance guiltily at their best friend.
The look Firn returned them was slightly offended, but they sighed and gave a light shrug. "You know what, fair. I've read the logs about the amount of times I got us killed."
"But at least now you can get some real practice," Hal still tried with a small, sheepish voice.
()
"Speaking of ships, Esker's on the Attlerock. If we're getting the founders together, we might as well give them the offer after this."

(The founders are given the bad news that considering the time and the fact that they have only one ship, they are not going to be able to pair them this loop. Firn gets them to record a message to their future selves, with the promise that they would be played only once, and that only the recipient would listen.)

Loop during which Slate and Hornfels are paired with the statues on the sun station, they end engulfed by the sun. Next loop:

The first sight that followed was one of fire right under their face, their hand holding a stick and poking at the root of the flames as if this orange light hadn't just been the executioner of their most painful demise.
Slate gasped and jerked back, getting their feet caught against the log they too little too late remembered they were supposed to be sitting on, and fell over. Clutching their chest with one hand, covering their eyes with the other, they took a second to recover from two pains — one vivid and yet vanished, only echoing distantly from a different time, and one very real, very present, in the back of their head, given the fact that the ground had not taken too kindly to the unexpected reunion with their thick skull.
As they tried to pull themself up, struggling to do so thanks to their legs being stuck higher than their arms, they heard some pained sleepy grunts not too far away.
Right. This was… this was the campfire they had been at. This was the campfire at which everything had started to evolve into utter insanity.
This was the campfire to the other side of which stood a young Hearthian who had been through the exact same experience.
They bit back their headache, hoping they had not been concussed in such a stupid way, and decided to break the ice. "…Firn?"
Firn rolled on their side to face them, responding with a very annoyed look. "…Well <i>that</i> was unpleasant."
The way this last word had been uttered, with a voice that almost broke into a sob and then strangled itself for it, betrayed the fact that they likely had an entirely different word in mind, and simply preferred putting their sarcasm to good use.
Slate watched still as the hatchling sat up, muttering that they <i>couldn’t believe Hal had been going through that all this time</i>.
Right.
"I thought it took you a few attempts to land your ship at the observatory," the engineer enquired with a raised eyebrow.
"The crash was <i>relatively</i> quick and painless," they retorted defensively with a shrug, nose up in the air and ears twitching hatchlingly. "It helps when the head is hit first."
Slate's mouth slammed shut. They stared, incapable of telling whether the expression on their face would reflect more horror, or concern, or disgust.
Stars.
This really was what they had gotten themself into, hadn't they.
"Anyway," Firn stammered slightly as they stood up, "this is Gossan's turn. Hal should be getting them here soon–" And looking up to the observatory, right on cue, two silhouettes trotted down the path to their camp. "–yep, here they are."
They looked down at Slate briefly, but were distracted before they could add anything more.
"Firn!" Hal called as soon as it felt like the distance separating them could be covered within the time required to say the name. "How did it go?"
Slate decided they might as well be the one answering. "Made our way there, got some *nasty* sunburns."
Hal turned to them and stared for a second or two, only to seemingly gasp in joy and relief, and crumple in guilt and sorrow at the same time. "…Ouch. Sorry about that, Slate." Blinking their eyes away, they sheepishly blurted out "I-it's not so bad after the first dozen times. You get used to it."
"Uh-huh. Getting roasted every three hours till we finally let the sun die. Can't wait." They had maintained their tone flat and factual. Gossan was here, after all.
Speaking of Gossan, their arms were crossed tight, and their three eyes had been continuously scanning the entire area in silence, waiting for their chance to remind the group of their presence.
"I believe there was something you needed to show me. So, what is it?"
Jumping back to business, Firn and Hal pointed at the ship, with Slate adding a third arm a second later.
"Gossan, there's something in my ship log you need to see," Firn said with a wavering voice. Slate did not fail to notice that this was the exact same sentence they had received the last time, and they also did not fail to notice that, more than last time, most likely because it was Gossan, the hatchling was avoiding their gaze and keeping their hands shut, trying to hide their tremors.
Gossan turned to Slate with an accusing look. "You're in it too, aren't you. Of course you would be."
Knowing what they were about to experience, Slate opted for a sly grin. "Sure. Tell yourself that while you still can. If that's still your opinion after you saw it, I will feel extremely flattered that you believe I am capable of faking *that*."
Gossan's frown carved itself deeper on their forehead, and they did not lose eye contact or make a single remark when one of the two hatchlings got the elevator working.
Once they disappeared from their field of vision, Slate found themself alone with their thoughts, and the sole company of the crackling of the fire.
Then they remembered that there was a third person who had just experienced death by sun for the first time, and reached for their radio as a wave of guilt overtook them. *Stars*, there was no way they would have taken it well.
"Hornfels?" they asked. "Do you copy?"
The radio returned static, then a shaking voice.
"Stars above, Slate. I had the most *awful*…"
Slate rolled their eyes, struggling to hide the tiniest smile. "Let me guess, 'dream'?" they interrupted gently. "Sorry, pal. That was real."
There was a long silence. Slate could almost hear distant, breathless wheezes.
"…*Stars above*," Hornfels repeated with ten times the despair.
()
"Where… Where are Hal and Firn?"
"They've left with Gossan. Gonna get them in it too."
An audible gulp. "I… I see."
()
"Say. How about you get out of there, for a change. Come here. Firn left an entire can of mallows behind. Fire's ready."
A pause. Then, in a tiny whisper: "…That would be nice."
()
The sun rose, looking seemingly normal. The two raised their heads as to follow it, now all too aware of what was waiting for them in just a few hours.

—

What if they needed to pair one more person for a specific reason, but even after the OPC was de-paired (……also see if that means the ATP can still run though, will the ATP run properly if there is no order to fire being sent?) and re-paired with someone else, all the masks were already taken? Hal and Gabbro would both offer to sacrifice their memories for it, but Hal can't because they are the only one fluent in both Nomai and Stranger, their opinion is
Hal looked around from the corner of their eyes, ears flicking nervously, thinking fast and slow at the same time. After gulping, they were the first to dare break the silence with immense hesitation. "I…"
Firn tsked them instantly. "Not you, absolutely not."
They blinked in panic, stepping back "I– I wasn't—"
"Yes you were, and Hal, don't you dare think that for a single second." "Even if you didn't *deserve* to stay just for the sheer amount of effort you have put into this, you are the only one here who's fluent in two alien languages we won't be able to survive without."
Hornfels gave them a soft but pained look, sighing sharply through their nose with their mouth shut tight. "The fact that you managed to get this far is a testament to your courage, Hal. I would not bear to let anything take those achievements from you. I will simply not have it."
Gabbro offers to give their place to Chert or Riebeck (or maybe Esker? They have a working ship and are closest to TH, + founder status) due to the fact that they do not have a ship, as theirs is not only lost to space, but also barely salvageable.
PS: Is it because the evacuation cannot properly happen fast enough because of Rutile being a pain each time, distrustful of space and Outer Wilds Ventures?

(Hearthians arguing as to what to do, offering other ways to how they could be convinced of following orders by each other if their memory were to be wiped. Suddenly, one realizes that Gabbro has left the group.)
"Wait. Gabbro?"
(They turn around, eyes widening in horror when they saw the Hearthian kneeling down, hands shaking… each holding one cut end of what used to be one intact cable.
Breath as steady as they could fake it, the astronaut slowly turned their head, albeit still staring at the ground and avoiding everyone's gaze.)
"It's done. No more arguing."
(Hal rushed to them, legs faltering and stumbling under the shock, shaking their head in panic.) "No no no no no *Gabbro!* What have you done!?"
Letting go of the ever so fragile (cables) and dropping their arms on their lap, they hung their head. Hal rushed to pick up the pieces, desperately trying to tie the ends back together. The mask did not flicker back to its former purple glow.
Gabbro tried to bring a steady hand on their shoulder, and Hal repressed the shiver of being touched by a ghost.
"My ship is no good. I'm just like Feldspar, I depend on someone else to pick me up if I want to reliably get anywhere off-planet. I'm dead weight, and you know it."
"*No you're not!" they cried out, already sobbing. "Y-you voidbrain!"
"You've known it since the beginning," they continued uninterrupted. "I could've done so much more if only I hadn't been so *careless*. I can't change what I used to be before the loops started, but now– I can finally make things right."
(Firn and Slate rush to them, Slate tools in hand, Firn giving them directions, and they manage to repair it. The mask does not come back to life, but it is fixed.)
The mask remained eerily quiet and dark, however. Firn's hands clenched into fists, trying not to show their tremors or explode in anger. "We have to pair them again," they stated gravely.
They stood up all at once then practically pounced on Gabbro, grabbing their arm hurriedly and pulling them to the return pad as they made a run for it. "No buts. Just pray we have enough time left to get there in time."
(Hal wonders whether Gabbro's memory would only be saved for this loop or also for all the previous ones, and they hope that the fact that Gabbro's current loop self is one who remembers means that their memory would be saved in full. Still, this only can happen if they make it in time.)
AN at the end of that chapter: "If you liked or hated this chapter, here are two fics that will give you trauma. The latter I like to nickname "Fuck You In Particular" with the utmost affection and admiration. Go read those two. I dare you. Break into tears and curl up into a ball questioning the meaning of life once you are ready."
—
(Also if there really is no other option, they would likely end with Slate, as they get confirmation that during past loops, they were relatively easy to convince thanks to Firn, Hal, and the ship log.)
"I trust you hatchlings to get me into it fast and easy. Don't let me give you too much trouble. If you don't manage quickly enough, I'm sure Hornfels will."





After Firn finally gets paired, they, Firn and Gabbro just spend a few loops messing around and catching up.
“Oh, oh geez, and there’s <i>Solanum</i> too!”
Firn raised an eyebrow, “Sola-who?”
“Oh you are <i>not</i> going to believe it, you’ll be making such a face when you see her!” “Don’t read your ship log just yet, I don’t want you to get spoiled, hah!”
Hal was practically hyperventilating with joy.
“You know what— Forget your ship log. Forget <i>all of it</i>, just for now, okay?” “Why read about everything when we could just <i>show</i> you all of it all over again? And have it STICK?” “Wouldn’t that be awesome? <i>All</i> of the solar system, and all the time in the universe to explore it.”
“You already know all of it, though,” Firn said with a teasing tone and grin, but with eyes looking away.
“And trust me, it is <i>so</i> worth looking at it again if you’re here for it— <i>really</i> here for it.” And before Firn could say anything, Hal was once again crushing them inside an overexcited hug. “Aaaaaah I still can’t <i>believe</i> you’re really here!”

They conveniently manage to dodge the supernova up until it’s time to pair Slate and Hornfels, meaning that Firn’s death at the sun station will be their first one (or at least, first one by supernova). Post-Stranger, Hal and Gabbro have been using another “supernova alarm” to instead send an alarm when the Stranger’s solar panels start to open, and they take this as a sign that they too should get away from the solar system.




Post-ATP, loop where Hal and Firn manage to get Hornfels, Gossan and Slate in the ATP:
Slate frowned. “It’s all well and good planning all this, but your ship wasn’t made with this many passengers in mind. If you tried to launch now, it would throw off the–”
Gossan gritted their teeth, “If I hear the words ‘thrust-to-weight ratio,’ Slate, something <i>else</i> is going to get thrown off this ship.”
Slate squinted. “–… capability of this ship to take off at all,” they concluded with a defiant grunt.




Post ATP: Hal could also, instead of removing the OPC from the loop, at first slightly alter its code so that every probe will instead be sent in the same direction, that of the same probe which found the Eye. This would open the possibility to then follow the probe and find it themselves, along with the signal blocker; and this would allow Firn’s ship to remember the coordinates.

Firn offers one loop to depart as soon as they wake up, alone, and follow the probe. If they land on the Eye, then the Eye will reject them? With a Quantum Solanum, if so:
"It is not time." "You seek knowledge, but only came to this place because you revel in impermanence. This place is not one for indecision."
"I'll, uh– Look, I'm sorry, I *really* didn't even know what I was about to find here, and now that I think about it it probably *should* have clicked that it'd be more important than I'd realized, but…"
Not-Solanum tilted its head. "Do not misunderstand. You are welcome here. Everyone is. It simply cannot be time yet." "Come back once you are ready."
Head trembling more than nodding, Firn took one step backwards, then a second, then a third. "I– I will. Sorry again, for, uh. I don’t know what for, but I’m sorry."
When Firn tries to take off and get out of the signal blocker's range, a vortex and thunder catches up with them, and they scream that they're sorry to have upset what might as well have been the universe itself, and then everything ends— when they open their eyes, they find themself inexplicably near Timber Hearth, and catch a glance of the quantum moon in the corner of their eye before it's gone with their first blink.
Hands shaking too hard to be trusted anywhere near the controls, Firn instead opted for turning on the radio.
"Hal? Can you hear me?"
"Firn! We lost contact for a few seconds. Are you okay?"
Firn frowned. "…A few <i>‘seconds’</i>?"
"Yeah, that was super quick, even the probe isn't back out yet it looks like. I guess you just took a peek to catch the coordinates and then flew right back out?"
Firn’s heart stopped for a moment.
The coordinates. Did their ship record the *coordinates?*
They unbuckled and dashed to their ship log, searching through their flight history—
…And took a deep breath.
Their ship seemed to not have been able to record the coordinates per se (its dependency to the Deep Space Satellite and the signal blocker perhaps having more to do with this part than *whatever everything else had been all about*), but it did keep an accurate record of multiple points throughout their trajectory, which had been on top of this perfectly linear for the majority of it. It was not *perfect*, but it was more than enough for someone like Chert or Hornfels to compute various numbers out of this raw data, and obtain the Eye’s coordinates — in Hearthian units. In units comprehensible to any Hearthian ship. In units which did not require the Vessel.

(Hal lost contact with them because of the signal blocker anyway. Next loop, when they ask Firn what they saw, they are shocked……… to not remember, somehow? Or if they do, they mention seeing a Nomai speaking Hearthian and how weird the conversation they had was, about the Eye 'rejecting' them because it was 'not time' yet. Asking the real Solanum, she muses that it is because of the time loop. One can only enter the Eye itself to collapse possibilities, but the ATP creates endless possibility. Trying to enter the Eye while the time loop is active could lead to… unforeseeable consequences, which the Eye might reject for the sake of everyone’s safety. Solanum is still enthralled that they managed to find the Eye, and urges them to seek it. Now that the ATP has fulfilled its function, it can be put to rest; and the legacy of the Nomai can fall into Hearthian hands.

While Firn follows the probe, Hal made it to the ATP/core of GD with the help of Gabbro, who would have first had to land on TH, then borrowed another ship?) and follows in real time.
Firn gasped. "The probe disappeared!"
In their radio, Hal gasped as well, for an entirely different reason: "It found the Eye! Firn, it's—"
Two things happened at once. First: the radio died. Second: where nothing stood a fraction of a second ago, now faded into view a massive, black, thundering and pulsing planet.
Firn had made it past the Stranger’s signal blocker.
[NB: the probe likely couldn't send the data to the OPC while it's within the cloaking though.]











Pairing Hornfels and Slate:
Firn: "Gotta give you a warning, the first time is totally going to feel overwhelming and intrusive. …Though the other times are also going to feel intrusive. Um. It's just not as bad. On average." "…Anyway. Are you both in position?"
Hornfels took a short breath, wishing they could rub their eyes without having their helmet in the way. "R– Ready, I believe." They truly were not, but the prospect of coming all this way, of having given the two hatchlings their word (both figuratively *and* literally in the form of a time-transcending audio recording), only to then not only go back on it but to also *forget* the hurt such self-centered decision would inevitably cause to the Hearthian species as a whole, felt like a much more terrifying outcome.
From the other side of the room, Slate crossed their arms. Their leg was (having nervous tremors). "Just get on with it."
Firn eyed them both, then turned to their signalscope. "Heard that, Hal?"
Static. "I'm injecting the code, then. Brace yourselves, you two."
The room turned back to silence, and for a few short instants, stillness instilled it. But the two adults only had the time to share one last glance of anticipation and worry before two mechanical *clangs* resonated simultaneously, and both statues readjusted themselves to meet with four pairs of eyes each.
Watching from a distance, Firn gasped as they saw purple lights — the same glowing eyes they had been met with on the first loop the universe had allowed them to remember, and the same incorporeal trails of condensed information they had seen the Ash Twin Project absorb straight from the masks at the end of this very same first loop.


Loop after Gossan was paired:
They looked down at their hands. Their gloves were back
"What in the…" Studying themself, they found their borrowed spacesuit gone and replaced with their atmosphere-requiring flight equipment instead.
()
"Gossan?"
Their ears twitched at the sound of their name, and they raised their head, in a more (saccadé) motion than they would have thought.
Hal’s voice had been small and quiet, just like their current anxious look was as they stared down at them.
"What happened?" They knew, and yet…
"We’re back to Timber Hearth," the hatchling
()
The founder went back to staring at their hand, and the unfamiliar and daunting feeling of falling to sleep somewhere, and waking up elsewhere, with the knowledge that the unfathomable hands of time itself had tucked them in bed and changed their clothes without their knowing.
"It's okay if you need a minute," Hal reassured. "Stars do I know I wished someone could've given me one on my first loops."
Gossan trembled, a nervous smirk appearing on their face against their will. "Was every time before the last one the same to me? The last time, before you came to, you had suddenly gone unresponsive for a whole minute or two, and…" Their eyes fell on their left hand, in position to delicately seize a chin that wasn't there. They shuddered at the question of just how many times they had adopted it. "…That must have been uncomfortable."
"It… got annoying fast, yeah."
Gossan frowned. "You were awake right away this time, though." A blink, then a short gasp. "Unless…"
"Yep. I guess we’ll get to be frozen together from now on," Hal joked shyly. "Good thing Marl didn’t seem to notice."
"Last time, I called after them because of the state you were in," Gossan mumbled. "I suppose… nobody will do that anymore."

Closing their eyes and taking a deep breath, they rolled their fingers into uncomfortable fists. "I am never going to get used to this," they sighed.

Loop where they tell the founders about Feldspar, and Gossan asks to go there alone with Hal as their guide. They die by anglerfish due to Gossan's anxiety and emotions making their hands unstable, and Hal, having gone through it before, tells them straight away (but not to the others through the radio).

Hal gritted their teeth, bracing for a short impact that would never physically come, then went closer to the comms. "Sorry, everyone. We're– we're not making it. Don't worry, we're gonna meet you in the next one, just go do something else in the meantime. We'll be– fine. We'll be fine."
Hal turned off the radio before anyone could respond or object. When they turned around, slowly, they met with Gossan's horrified expression.
"Hal, I'm… I was careless, you shouldn’t have to pay for my mistake…" "There is no way being digested by an anglerfish is going to be anything but slow and painful," they whispered shakily, surprising themself with even the fact that they would be brought to say such thing.
Hal nodded, taking a deep sigh. "Fortunately for the both of us, this isn't the way we're gonna go this time."
Three eyes widened at once. "You don’t mean…"
Hal had walked all the way to the reactor and then crouched down, hand dangerously close to the opening. "I'm afraid I am," and Gossan shuddered at the lack of emotion in the hatchling's statement. "We've got options. I know my favorite, but, it'd be selfish to force it upon you without asking."
Gossan stared at Hal’s hand, ready to open the protective shell and expose whatever was under there to whatever plans they had evidently already put to motion before.

(Next loop)
Gossan gasped and staggered back,
Something grabbed them and pulled them towards an unknown destination, and they tried to resist, but this force had more motivation and momentum than their body had with how little balance it had and how dangerously close to the cliff it was—
…Oh.
Gossan opened their eyes, and saw that Hal had pulled them into an awkward embrace, gently and slowly dragging them away from the edge of a cliff which they had almost slipped over.
Well that would have been an embarrassing way to go, and a difficult loop to explain.








The plan is to pair Slate first, given their proximity to Firn’s ship, and for that they decide to go with one of the statues in the sun station given the tighter time limit. Slate’s recording to themself is rather brief and concise.
“Hey. Uh. Me. I’m supposed to be saying something to convince you that there is a time loop, but I bet that just hearing my own voice talking to myself through a recording should be enough on its own. So whatever I’ll say next after that… it’s probably just going to be words so you can be sure that it’s really your own voice talking, and not someone faking it.” “Whatever the rookie tells you to do, do it. Judging from the calculations they did last time, we have less than two hours before we’ve blown our chance to get in. And, I already said yes to that plan, so don’t be a voidhead. They’ve been having a way harder time than you could ever imagine. Should’ve been there for them much sooner.”
Maybe they also attempt to have Hornfels get the other sun station statue at the same time? It would be funny if they got Slate in the ship, and while they wer listening to the recording, Firn just got the ship to land on or right by the entrance of the observatory, right as Hal is pulling Hornfels out.
Firn’s head popped out from the hatch, upside down. “Come on! That maneuver was hard enough as it is, might as well make it worth it!”
Hornfels’ mouth was hanging open, Hal rolled their eyes. “I <i>thought</i> we had agreed that you wouldn’t try that one again.”
“It worked <i>this</i> time!” they argued with a pout. “Told you I could do it.”
Hal grabbed Hornfels’ hand and pushed them towards the beam before the elder could regain enough words to protest. “Yeah, it just took you four loops.”
“I can finally <i>learn</i> how to pilot that thing and have it stick, you said it yourself! Please let me have this.”
(Hal is not coming due to the lack of space in the ship…? There is only Firn, Slate (who was already convinced) and Hornfels. As soon as Hornfels is in, Slate points them to the ship log and gives them the helmet, giving them the most serious and devastated look they can manage without losing face and looking desperate.)
“Your turn,” they merely said, nodding their head towards the screen. Hornfels saw that an audio recording was ready to be played, and that for some unfathomable reason, it had their name on it. Looking back to Slate, they find no explanation other than four stern and determined eyes, putting on a brave face yet hiding so much more. “We’re on a tight schedule, so try to listen quick,” Before the engineer turned around, they shared one last piece of advice, this time failing to hide their pain and fear. “You’re… gonna want to sit down.”
And with that, Slate kneeled down and tinkered with the floor, catching Firn’s attention. As soon as the young astronaut saw what they were doing, their eyes widened and they sputtered in confusion:
“Wait, why are you opening the hatch?”
Slate rolled their eyes, sighing. “Look, I get it, we have to be quick, and you managed to pull off a crazy stunt for the sake of it. But if we’re going out there, we are going to need <i>spacesuits</i>, genius.”
(Meanwhile, Hal went up to the observatory and uses the comms to radio Gabbro, spending time together just chatting.)
By the time Slate jumped back into the ship with two spare suits, Hornfels had pulled out the helmet and was staring into the void between matter itself, face distorted with horror, mouth covered by a shaking hand. Just as Slate had predicted, they were sitting in a corner of the ship, surrounded by the Outer Wilds Ventures posters they had themselves contributed to designing, gripping the ledge of the tiny wooden bench as if the ship were in motion with its artificial gravity defunct.
(Hal may, in fact, go in the ship, maybe. If they do, then it is because they part ways on Ash Twin in order to go to the ATP and tinker with the masks, while Firn, Slate and Hornfels tinker with the statues one at a time. Or… do they tinker with the statues? Or is the ATP the part that needs tinkering instead? Also, it is most likely better to maneuver those with a Nomai staff, actually, something which only Hal would have been able to entirely figure out.)

(On the Sun station, Firn is asking Slate for some of the tools on their belt or in their box, quickly tinkering )


Gossan:
“Please take care of the hatchlings for me. They shouldn’t have that burden on their shoulders. They can’t do it alone, and they shouldn’t have to.”

Endgame plan for the last loop: evacuate everyone on the Stranger, while Hal and Firn(?) fetch the advanced warp core and get the Vessel to the eye so that it survives the supernova. From there, they find and disable the Stranger's signal blocker, and with Hal having taught someone (Gossan or Slate if they're still in the loop) how to pilot and turn the Stranger visible again, they become able to radio each other.
Endgame plan is for Hal to contact other Nomai clans, asking for and offering help, suggesting for all to wait the end of the universe together, and meet up at the Eye together. Maybe, with the Eye broadcasting and Gossan and Hal getting the Stranger to orbit it, the Nomai will simply come by themselves.



Hal in the simulation, writing down to strangers:
"You can wake me, but I can always come back.
We found the computer running your simulation. If we wished you any harm, you would already be dead by now and you wouldn’t even know it."
They looked back up, cranking their neck, and their determined eyes met the shift to horror and fear in what a split second ago would have been a pursuer, but now looked like an overgrown fawn squeaking and stumbling back a few steps. Hal had already started writing their next sentence.
"This is not a threat. I am not here to hurt you. We just want to talk."
Standing up and taking a step back, both arms gestured to their new message and they stared with stern intent, giving a light nod to their head.
The pursuer's feathers slowly ruffled back to their default state, even though they hardly seemed any more at ease. They croaked, "Who are you?"
()
"My home planet is near the current location of your ship, and we discovered it by chance. It has been a very, very long time since you all last went to sleep." "Sorry for only answering in writing. I am still learning your oral language, and my body is not capable of making the sounds required."
