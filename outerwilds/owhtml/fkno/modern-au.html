<div class=shiplog id=int_><h1>Disclaimer:</h1><p>Even more in this AU than in the others (and this is saying something), the whys and hows for the entire worldbuilding here are extremely wobbly, based on vibes and “Do not think about it too hard” alone, and the only two reasons any work was put into it at all are the following:</p><ol><li>The setup and the way it grew in the span of just a few days gave a few opportunities for new shenanigans that break all known laws of physics, but are funny and/or good for drama?</li><li>I have, unfortunately, very good and amazing friends. And a massive enabler named <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/users/merrydock/pseuds/merrydock>merrydock</a> who would not let me forget about this AU even if I tried.</li></ol><p>So, uh, yeah, just don’t ask why Hearthians in this new universe have their culture based off the stereotypical Western capitalist system or whatever this is supposed to be, or whether “Area 22” is real or not (it’s most likely not, Firn just watches too many sci-fi movies).</p><p><i>Some</i> elements in the History of this world are supposed to make sense, but most of pretty much everything, especially the “quantum” shenanigans that the Eye does through Hal, is really just “the author thought it’d be funny/interesting/good for drama/made it in because of her enabler/insert random and 100% subjective reason.”</p></div>
<div class=shiplog id=int_><h1>Story Context:</h1><ul>
    <li>This AU took inspiration from <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/works/55439206/><i>Erasure</i></a> by Fridurmus, <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/works/55412944/><i>Time Pressure</i></a> by Evalka, and the fact that the OW Discord server I hang out in a lot had a “Draw everyone in dapper suits” event going on, thus beaming into my brain dozens of images of Hearthians in fancy modern clothes.</li>
    <li>After going to the <span class=lblue>Eye</span> at the end of FKNO, Hal’s new universe is created with one last thought — the lingering regret that Hearthians were not given the chance to prosper as a species, not only due to the supernova and the heat death of the universe, but even because of the regular dangers of Timber Hearth which continuously dwindled both the population of Hearthians and the planet’s biodiversity as a whole.</li>
    <li>14.3 billion years later, the solar system has reformed in a quite similar shape to how it used to be in the previous universe, with the notable distinction that the <span class=lblue>Eye</span> is now absent. Because of this, neither the Stranger nor the Nomai ever came.</li>
    <li>Additionally, following Hal’s last regret, the “bramble” as a plant species never developed, the geysers on Timber Hearth are no longer powerful enough to send objects and people into orbit, and though the Interloper did get captured by the sun’s gravity, ghost matter no longer exists.</li>
    <li>Hearthian society has been able to develop and grow to a much larger scale than in the previous universe, with their daily lives being now close to human 21st century Western culture. The absence of Nomai ruins to explore and tinker with has ironically slowed down their spacefaring progress, and although Outer Wilds Ventures is pretty much the Hearthian equivalent of NASA, no living being has yet been sent into space (not for a lack of trying from Feldspar).</li>
    <li>Hal, after slumbering for 14.3 billion years, awakens on this new Timber Hearth, already surprised by the fact alone that they are somehow still alive. However, as they learn more about this new vastly different world, another discovery soon leaves them in shock: according to this new Hearthian society, they never existed.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class=shiplog id=int_><p>Last warning: Since this is first and foremost an AU based off vibes and fun Discord conversations, it is a gigantic mess. Drawing comics takes an awfully long time too, so you should not expect the highest quality by any means, and you should in fact be pleasantly surprised when you happen to see a scene occur in chronological order uninterrupted for more than a single page. Sorry for that, fingers crossed for me to find the time and inspiration to fill in the blanks sooner rather than later!</p></div>
