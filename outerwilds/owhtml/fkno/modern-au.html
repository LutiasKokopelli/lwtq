<!-- @SFOLD Context & Intro -->
<!-- <div class=shiplog id=int_><h1>Disclaimer:</h1><p>Even more in this AU than in the others (and this is saying something), the whys and hows for the entire worldbuilding here are extremely wobbly, based on vibes and “Do not think about it too hard” alone, and the only two reasons any work was put into it at all are the following:</p><ol><li>The setup and the way it grew in the span of just a few days gave a few opportunities for new shenanigans that break all known laws of physics, but are funny and/or good for drama?</li><li>I have, unfortunately, very good and amazing friends. And a massive enabler named <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/users/merrydock/pseuds/merrydock>merrydock</a> who would not let me forget about this AU even if I tried.</li></ol><p>So, uh, yeah, just don’t ask why Hearthians in this new universe have their culture based off the stereotypical Western capitalist system or whatever this is supposed to be, or whether “Area 22” is real or not (it’s most likely not, Firn just watches too many sci-fi movies).</p><p><i>Some</i> elements in the History of this world are supposed to make sense, but most of pretty much everything, especially the “quantum” shenanigans that the Eye does through Hal, is really just “the author thought it’d be funny/interesting/good for drama/made it in because of her enabler/insert random and 100% subjective reason.”</p></div> -->
<div class=shiplog id=int_><h1>Story Context:</h1>
    <ul><p class=hudgrey><u>Origin:</u> This AU took inspiration from <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/works/55439206/ target=_blank><i>Erasure</i></a> by Fridurmus, <a href=https://archiveofourown.org/works/55412944/ target=_blank><i>Time Pressure</i></a> by Evalka, and the fact that the Campfire Discord server had a “Draw everyone in dapper suits” event going on, thus beaming into my brain dozens of images of Hearthians in fancy modern clothes.</p></ul>
    <hr style='margin:2em auto;background:rgba(var(--white),.5);width:calc(100% - 4.2em)'>
    <p align=center><i>Ye who entered the Eye, shall now become the Eye.</i></p>
    <p align=center><i>A new world needs to be made; its laws trust your judgment.</i></p>
    <hr style='margin:2em auto;background:rgba(var(--white),.5);width:calc(100% - 4.2em)'>
    <p>After going to the <span class=lblue>Eye</span> at the end of FKNO, a new universe is created following Hal’s dearest wishes for the future… as well as their grief for a past cut short too soon. Hal slumbers with the lingering regret that Hearthians were not given the chance to prosper as a species, not only due to the supernova and the heat death of the universe, but even before then, because of the regular dangers of Timber Hearth which had continuously dwindled both the population of Hearthians and the planet’s biodiversity as a whole.</p>
    <p>14.3 billion years later, the Hearthian solar system has reformed in a <i>similar enough</i> shape to how it used to be in the previous universe, albeit in a way such that it fits the new laws of physics introduced with this new universe — which are, on the surface level at least, pretty much the same as our own’s. As a consequence, the sun and planets are now much bigger and much further apart from each other, and planets are now capable of handling much larger, richer, thicker atmospheres.</p>
    <p>Moreover, following Hal’s wishes for safety and prosperity, any source of natural disasters that could be tamed or avoided entirely has been either erased or diminished in order to be far less deadly than they used to be. To quote MAU Firn upon learning about this: “…So you made it boring on purpose.”</span></p>
    <details open class=hudgrey style='padding:.5em 1.7em'><summary><u>This includes the following changes:</u></summary><ul>
        <li>Though <span class=lblue>the Interloper</span> did get captured by the sun’s gravity, ghost matter has been erased from existence, and therefore it is only a regular comet made out of good old ice and rock, with no exotic particles involved.</li>
        <li>The “bramble” as a plant species does not exist; therefore, the fifth planet in the solar system is still intact, and it has been named “<span class=lblue>Distant Brine</span>” (in order to keep the DB acronym for some semblance of clarity).</li>
        <li>The geysers on <span class=lblue>Timber Hearth</span> are no longer powerful enough to send objects and people into orbit. If only because they are, relatively to the size of the planet itself, much smaller.</li>
        <li><span class=lblue>Giant’s Deep</span>’s cyclones are far less common and powerful.</li>
        <li>The volcanic activity of <span class=lblue>Hollow’s Lantern</span> is either much more tame (none of its projectiles can leave the moon’s own gravity), or entirely dormant.</li>
        <li><span class=lblue>Brittle Hollow</span>… It hasn’t yet been decided, but it is likely that it in fact does <i>not</i> contain a black hole (and its rock composition, while still very intriguing for different reasons, does not hold any latent gravitational distortion properties), and that the solar system’s white hole no longer exists. It may also be the case because of this universe’s new laws of physics — chances are warping via black/white hole pairs isn’t going to be compatible with life anymore, if feasible at all. That part is still a moot point.</li>
        <li>Also a sort of moot point, but it’s likely that the <span class=lblue>Hourglass Twins</span>’ sand exchange is no longer a thing. Not yet decided whether this means that Ash Twin is forever buried under piles of sand, or whether said sand does not exist at all.</li>
        <li>Finally: for reasons yet unknown, the <span class=lblue>Eye of the universe</span> is currently absent from this solar system. This means that although both the Owlks and Nomai still exist out there, <b class=orng>neither the Stranger nor the Vessel ever came to visit</b>.</li>
    </ul></details>
    <p>With all this, Hearthian society has been able to develop and grow to a much larger scale than in the previous universe, with their daily lives being now close to stereotypical human 21st century Western culture (not yet decided on how close it would get to actual human Earth, it is… massive. I am not ready to delve into the topic of countries or multiple cultures and all that and there are a lot of real world things I. do not want to think about fjdkslmgjmsqdk. I just want this AU to be about the slice-of-life shenanigans of Hearthians trying to live their daily lives in a world that has capitalism and Youtube).</p>
    <p>Generally speaking, Hearthian technology is more advanced in this universe than it was in the previous one; on the other hand, the absence of Nomai ruins to explore and tinker with (alongside the new scales of the planets and space between them) has ironically slowed down their spacefaring progress. Although Outer Wilds Ventures is pretty much the Hearthian equivalent of NASA, <b class=orng>no living being has yet been sent into space</b> (not for a lack of trying from Feldspar).</p>
    <p>And with the context now fully given, the story can begin:</p>
    <hr style='margin:2em auto;background:rgba(var(--white),.5);width:calc(100% - 4.2em)'>
    <p>Hal, after slumbering for 14.3 billion years, awakens one day on this new Timber Hearth. They are already confused by the fact alone that they are somehow still alive, but this new universe has even more surprises to come. First and foremost, as they soon meet with this world’s versions of Firn and Hornfels, another discovery soon leaves them in shock:</p>
    <p>According to this new Hearthian society, they never existed.</p>
</div>
<div class=shiplog id=int_><p>Little warning: Since this is first and foremost an AU based off vibes and fun Discord conversations, it is currently a gigantic mess. Drawing comics takes an awfully long time too, so you should not expect the highest quality by any means, and you should in fact be pleasantly surprised when you happen to see a scene occur in chronological order uninterrupted for more than a single page. Sorry for that, fingers crossed for me to find the time and inspiration to fill in the blanks sooner rather than later!</p></div>

<h1 id=mau_day1>Day 1: Hal’s arrival</h1>




<p>Hornfels calling Gossan after they have the nearly-complete adoption papers and notice that Hal and Firn are gone:</p>
<p>Hornfels: “So. Should I warn the hospital and possibly the police, considering the fact that they are already involved and probably still hanging out downstairs? Or, do I go the Sleep Tight route?”</p>
<p>Gossan, nodding wisely: “Sleep Tight route. I’ll make sure they come back soon.”</p>
<p>Five minutes later, a nurse enters the hospital room, asking how the adoption conversation went, but then Hornfels just shushes them, saying that the hatchling is asleep and must have been more exhausted than they realized. The nurse squints at the bed, totally not neatly decorated with additional pillows stacked under the covers, then turns around with a sigh.</p>

Gossan while removing their helmet: “Heh, sorry about that. I know the masks look intimidating at first, but you get used to it.” “So, uh, seeing that you somehow warped into our Vessel out of nowhere, you must have quite the story to tell. You some kind of time traveler or something?”

<div class=chp>
All Hearthians are born with an impossible to explain with science, yet long-proven by History, insane and unbreakable luck. Except Slate.
The universe doesn't *hate* Slate, it just wants their life to be mildly infuriating on a regular enough basis. Hearthians had absolutely no idea of their species' insane luck until they either 1) met aliens (who have *normal* luck), 2) Slate was born (but they just assumed at this time that *bad luck* was a thing somehow, without realizing that they all just had crazy luck all along).
When Gossan shows up and learns about Slate's treatment, they do apologize for it. It's not fair, their feelings shouldn’t have been redirected at *this* Slate.

merrydock — Today at 8:32 PM
Awwwwww
Gossan wishes for Slate to have normal luck....
(They fall in love....)
(Gosslate real.....)
Lutias Kokopelli — Today at 8:44 PM
(You know I'm not one to write romance but. That is an interesting thought.)
(Especially if crossover happens and Gossan meets OG Slate later)
merrydock — Today at 8:46 PM
I was just thinking....because Gossan and Gossan's Universe Slate wouldn't have any bad history......
Not that it needs to be particularly romantic to be interesting, but.....
Lutias Kokopelli — Today at 8:46 PM
They don't have any bad history in Hal and Firn's universes either but
Gossan's version is interesting because it has both sides 👀
(so would be Slate's technically but. In the Slate/Gossan dispute we all know that 99% of the spite comes from Gossan)
merrydock — Today at 8:47 PM
YEAH
So Gossan is kind of forced to confront their (perhaps warranted, perhaps not) anger towards Slate in the not-so-subtle "the universe hates Slate and treats them unfairly because you do" way
Lutias Kokopelli — Today at 8:53 PM
I still have no idea what Gossan's universe would actually be like besides that (maybe like Hal's and Riebeck's, their universe would have a huge Hearthian population due to getting rid of the danger / having such insane luck that the Interloper managed to not crack until it fell into the sun and disintegrated or just flew in the solar system and flew out immediately afterwards without cracking), but. I do want to flesh out this universe now fjsdklm
Slate from Gossan's universe meeting OG Slate for the first time (somehow): So it's you who ruined my entire life, huh
OG Slate: what the fuck are you talking about
Gabbro from Gossan's universe, in the back: hey Hornfels did you give me those ten bucks for that time we made a bet about the source of Slate's bad luck and you made fun of me when I offered "annoyed god in a previous life"

merrydock — Today at 9:05 PM
I like the idea of it being safe like the others but also like...Still exciting? Gossan was a pilot, after all
Hmmm...
If you don't want the nomai around, then maybe it's just that the hearthians are immune to ghost matter? So it's not a fully wholesome idyllic society like Riebeck's but the hearthians are safe, which is what Gossan cares about most?
Lutias Kokopelli — Today at 9:06 PM
(also was just reminded of the "what if in some universes Hearthians evolved to have a somewhat different biology" idea so that's a thread that might as well be put in the magic hat of plot bunnies)
Lutias Kokopelli — Today at 9:07 PM
................................FKNO Timber Hearth bugs are capable of seeing ghost matter and avoiding it easily
(but also maybe Hearthians from this universe are in general just even more stupidly difficult to injure than they already are normally)
merrydock — Today at 9:09 PM
Oooh yeah!
So you could still have them go off and be dumb in space, it's just less likely to actually kill them cause they are more robust (also plays into the "they are luckier" thought)
Lutias Kokopelli — Today at 9:10 PM
Hearthians from Gossan's universe are all a bunch of Feldspar's levels of reckless because there are just zero consequences to them crashing other than "dang it that'll take a week to rebuild"
(...and this factors in Slate's bad luck because of course they're the one who will have to rebuild those)

Steampunk/highly industrial based. Slate kinda secludes themself in a workshop and half-builds half-magically conjures up stuff and inventions in order to sort of. Not have to think about the fact that the founders don’t know who they are anymore.

Gabbro: Like how Firn *really* pushed it with the science and space exploration, and you with the... [looks around at the walls, pursing their lips, then at their suit] ...fancier clothes?

Gabbro: Shush, we don't criticize the owner of the place.
