<p class=vs>Since this stranger had made their way to his home, the young archaeology professor had found himself surrounded by an immeasurable number of questions.</p>
<p class=vs>Since he had heard two words from their mouth, these two simple words, he had suddenly found himself with only one of them, which had driven out all the others and now imposed itself in his mind with the same discretion and restraint as that of an elephant which would start dancing salsa by your side as you would find yourself stuck within the claustrophobic walls of an elevator shaft.</p>
<p class=vb>It was such a simple question to ask, such a short one, one limited to only four words; but those same words were as heavy with meaning as were the playful paws of the proboscidean mammal which was currently busy cluttering the back of his mind.</p>
<p class=vb><i>How did you know?</i></p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vs>Several minutes had already passed since Clay had once again started to show signs of instability in their appearance: a few strands of hair here and there fighting against an unexpected color change, skin and cloth alike acting somewhat similar to the surface of a puddle that would be lightly brushed by the wind…</p>
<p class=vs>Once the topic of this <i>forgotten brother</i> broached, their apprehension had become all the more evident, and if only in this precise moment, even more intense than his own; and as always, any feeling of unease from their part was accompanied with a body that would quake in a way quite different from the one normally dictated by biology.</p>
<p class=vs>It was rather sad to admit, but he had quickly grown accustomed to such a sight, albeit reluctantly so. He was unsure whether he should have been congratulating or blaming his sharp sense of observation, for being able to perceive tremors which, in the end, had now become barely noticeable. Had he not known any better, he would certainly have imagined that all that had to be seen in front of him was a perfectly normal, young teenager wearing a perfectly normal blue sweater and cap, and that if he thought he was seeing anything out of the ordinary, it had to be because his eyes were playing tricks on him, or because the wind outside must have made the branches of a tree move around, creating a dance of shadows and lights which would have been reflected on the face of a perfectly normal, albeit extremely upset child.</p>
<p class=vb>Evidently, Clay was indeed making a lot of progress when it came to taming their newfound ability. Their appearance had yet to become fully stable; but this was still a massive improvement from what he had seen until this point. Barely half an hour earlier, a similar state of anxiety had led them to rapidly and uncontrollably jump from face to face, to such extent that they had even momentarily lost all traits that could have defined the individuality of a human being—a detail which everyone, themselves included, eagerly wished to forget.</p>
<p class=vs>These signs of instability, however, were not negligible; and thus, when the moment came for a cup of tea to fall to the ground and break, the crash spread throughout the entire room with the devastating impact of a tsunami.</p>
<p class=vs>It had begun when the child screamed, raising both hands to their mouth in shock and fright; and as this cry resounded, shrill and short, it was as if the fracture of the white porcelain on the wooden floor, in spite of the table masking the scene from their view, had generated a shock wave powerful enough to reach and spread throughout their entire being from the bottom up, breaking the flow of the usual swell. And so, as with the impetus of a rogue wave, this tremor plunged into the darkness, grabbed hold of every secret that remained in the shadows, and dragged them with it to the surface; the resulting swirl then took care of capsizing with force and cruelty all that was previously drifting afloat.</p>
<p class=vb>From toe to head, the tidal bore spread over the little being’s entire body the same way it ascends rivers, and left nothing behind except for the distraught face of a child, who appeared to be barely seven or eight years old.</p>
<p class=vb>Contrary to the real person he thought he had in front of him, this new child, of whom he now saw a grimly faithful reproduction, was far from being a stranger. This little boy with big eyes and curly caramel brown hair, sporting a charming white shirt and a sleeveless orange sweater, with a face so distant, yet all at the same time so strikingly familiar…</p>
<p class=vb>This last transformation was what finally guided him towards the painful truth that the time traveller had been so reluctant to reveal.</p>
<p class=vb>It not only allowed him to remember this truth; but far more than just this, it invited him, willingly or not, to relive it before his very eyes.</p>
<p class=vs>Because the face he now had before him was the true embodiment of a past that had haunted him during his entire life, without him having even been able to fully remember or detect its presence. Because the face he had before him was looking back, like the ghost of these childhood fears that you naïvely thought had disappeared, but which in reality have never stopped following you like your own shadow, with the sole intent of weighing you down, of pushing you to question your place in the world, of making you doubt everything up to the core of our very identity, as if your own name no longer belonged to you. Because the face in front of him was a carbon copy of a face he had not seen in over twenty years, and whose very existence he had forgotten.</p>
<p class=vb>Because this face…</p>
<p class=vb>…belonged to his brother.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vb>For a moment, he felt as if he had been dropped off a cliff and into the depths of his memory. The far too clear, far too vivid image of this child who belonged to the past and who in his present could no longer be one, focused all his attention to such a point that everything else around him had disappeared.</p>
<p class=vb>During this moment, he no longer saw his small and cosy apartment, but rather the huge and wide walls of an empty country house, which seemed far too familiar to him, which he had been forced to leave one day as a child, and in which he had never been able to set foot ever again.</p>
<p class=vb>During this brief moment, the warm, late afternoon sun from the other side of the large double window had given way to a cold, blood-curdling night; within the chilling silence had begun to resound pleading cries and screams; within the frame of the closed front door, which he now imagined wide open, were painted strange men in dark uniforms, menacing with their gigantic weapons a horrified couple. No, not just any couple… Those were his parents. His real parents.</p>
<p class=vb>During this short, yet endless moment, he swore that he could hear the whispers of his older brother—urging him to leave, to hide. He swore that an invisible and terrified arm, desperate and on the verge of tears, was pulling him with the firm intent of bringing to safety the only member of his family who could still be saved. He remembered his reluctance, his anguish, his breathless cries at the idea of letting his parents go with these strange and terrifying men; he remembered that his father and mother were taken away, never to return.</p>
<p class=vb>After this moment, once he remembered that time was meant not to remain in stasis, but to pass… He remembered that this had only been a memory, and not reality; and he remembered that what stood before his eyes was not a ghost from his past, but rather a petty impostor who had stolen the face of another.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vb>Even the creaking of his chair was not loud enough to pull him out of his thoughts and make him realise that he had stood up. The hurricane rushing through his mind created a cacophony powerful enough to drown out any insignificant distractions. He who usually would never miss a single detail, was currently unable to look away from this nameless person, whom he thought was a stranger, and who nevertheless knew so much about him; who seemed to know more about his own life than he did himself. It was not only impossible for him to focus on anything other than this complete stranger; but it was also impossible for him to put his reflections and deductions in order, the thread of his reason having become tangled within the vice of his emotions.</p>
<p class=vb>Hershel Layton was a wise and unusually thoughtful young man for his age, who never raised his voice, and who never let his anger out in the open—assuming he ever allowed himself to feel such resentment toward anyone, no matter the circumstances.</p>
<p class=vb>However, at this very moment, he had just been handed a mountain of broken and fuzzy memories which, in spite of their lack of order, and in spite of the inevitable distortions that these two decades of forgetfulness will have brought, had just reminded him of a crucial detail.</p>
<p class=vb>Was he really ‘Hershel Layton’?</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vb>He sharply turned toward the entrance, already about to grab a receiver, then input a certain set of numbers—only to see the door shut and hear Claire’s muffled whispers, as she was still deeply invested in a conversation about fundamental physics which sought to preserve the integrity of the universe as they knew it. Not without disappointment, he found himself with no other choice but to reconsider, hoping that she would not take much longer or, heaven forbid, come back with even more bad news than they already had.</p>
<p class=vb>His hands trembling with apprehension, incomprehension, perhaps even injustice, he glared at this personified mystery and had eyes only for one objective: the truth, absolute and complete. As a result… Questions burst forth.</p>
<p class=vb>“Where did you see this face? How could you know about him?”</p>
<p class=vs>Clay shivered, looked down at themselves, shivered again in horror, and traversed at least three or four formless faces before they could successfully reshape that of a teenage Luke Triton, whose sweater had however mistakenly retained an orange tint. They opened their mouth, closed it, but found themselves unable to utter a single constructed or recognisable word, instead stammering short, sorry and panicked ramblings.</p>
<p class=vb>This was not the type of reply that the man wanted to hear, and thus he carried on:</p>
<p class=vb>“I would be surprised if anyone could have kept pictures after they… You couldn’t have seen his face through such means, could you? Unless—Never mind. Even in this case, it means that you had to already be present at this time…?”</p>
<p class=vb>Each of his sentences was punctuated by truncated replies from the stranger, which were limited to unconvinced denials and variations of the same sentence, always claiming and emphasising their ignorance. Regardless, he seemed to have forgotten the very fact that he was asking questions, for he had stopped waiting for an answer.</p>
<p class=vb>“If you can perfectly remember his face from back then, you must have been around our parents at some point, either before or after they disappeared. But then…”</p>
<p class=vb>“Professor, I don’t think—”</p>
<p class=vb>“How old are you really?”</p>
<p class=vb>“N-no, I—”</p>
<p class=vb>“When they were abducted, what were your ties with them? <i>Who are you?</i>”</p>
<p class=vb>“<i>I don’t know!</i>”</p>
<p class=vb>Just as suddenly as he had started… Finally, the archaeologist fell silent.</p>
<p class=vs>The words that led him to do so were not any different to the previous ones, in the sense that they brought no new information, and were otherwise just another repetition of what the entity had been trying to say for several minutes—for much longer than that, even.</p>
<p class=vs>Yet, somehow… It was precisely because they did not bring anything new on their own, that they gave him a crucial piece of information. This was a puzzle piece that he had in theory already had in hand ever since the very moment they had met… but of which he had begun to question the veracity, as the absurdity of this situation and the recent shock of his emotions had encouraged him to doubt whether it truly belonged to the truth behind this mystery.</p>
<p class=vb>These last words had however been uttered with as much conviction and sincerity, as with despair and helplessness. These words made him remember this stranger’s dismay, made him remember the fact that they had consciously chosen not to lie when they had been given an easy opportunity to do so, made him remember the infinite gratitude that they had expressed when he had been able to find and share with them the first and only hint toward their original identity, however small it was. These words made him understand for the second time, and this time once and for all, that in spite of and against all logic…</p>
<p class=vb>Clay was just as clueless as he was.</p>
<p class=vb>He had intended to put this hypothesis to the test. Every action they had taken, every word that had come out of their mouth, he had examined with a fine-tooth comb; and yet, he had been unable to refute it. Finally, this last outburst of panic had overflowed with such a pure and spontaneous sincerity, that it had reminded him of all the other occurrences; and this accumulation had finally dispelled his doubts.</p>
<p class=vb>Despite all his efforts, not once had the young professor been able to see the slightest trace of dishonesty in the eyes of this stranger. It would have been so much simpler, so much more logical, so much easier, to have tangible proof that Clay was not who they claimed to be—that they had hidden interests, that they secretly kept ulterior motives, that they… Ah, but what could they possibly have been planning anyway? They had already saved Claire’s life and, at least from their account, those of many others. It was difficult to imagine that they could aim to save even more lives, and all at the same time be ill-intentioned.</p>
<p class=vs>They showed no resistance to speaking about what they knew of the past, present or future, aside from their awareness that these truths were painful to hear. It was only when one came to question the exact origin of such incongruously precise knowledge, or ask them about anything that regarded them personally in one way or another, that their lips were sealed in this reluctant silence.</p>
<p class=vb>At first, he had naturally assumed that the reason behind this silence had to be purely and solely because they did not want to talk about it. However, on second thought… He began to wonder if, perhaps, as counterintuitive as it seemed… The truth was that they were simply <i>unable</i> to answer him. Their embarrassment and reluctance were due not only to the fact that they knew so much about him, and that they at least seemed to have <i>some</i> semblance of understanding that this knowledge they held was a flagrant violation of his privacy; but maybe it was also due to the fact that they knew full well that <i>nothing</i> about them made any sense.</p>
<p class=vb>Their ever-changing body, their partial yet suspiciously specific amnesia, their incongruous knowledge… Each of these elements defied logic; and as he was finally beginning to see it, Clay was actually the first to lament about it. Even their personality was difficult to pin down, which contributed to the fact that their presumptions had constantly oscillated from one hypothesis to another: child or adult? Innocent amnesiac or ill-intentioned mastermind? Too many elements around them were as absurd as they were contradictory, and Clay themselves appeared to have sought answers regarding the mystery of their own existence, to no avail.</p>
<p class=vb>The young professor took a deep breath, followed by a deep, strained sigh; he slowly returned to his seat; he closed his eyes, and sighed again as he nervously rubbed his temples. If he wanted… No, if <i>they</i> wanted to solve this mystery, then the only way was to remain calm and methodical.</p>
<p class=vb>He looked up: Clay buried a pale head in their shoulders, looked down sheepishly, and bit their lip. His own were pinched into a thin line.</p>
<p class=vb>“…Forgive me for my outburst,” he finally whispered with great restraint, avoiding their gaze.</p>
<p class=vb>“N-no,” they replied instantly, “you have… That’s normal. Anyone would have reacted like that in your place. You really don’t need to apologize for that…”</p>
<p class=vs>He nodded silently. He wished he could say that the idea of having unjustly mistreated his guest would have made him feel at least the smallest pang of guilt, but… Maybe it was still a little too early for him to really find the inner strength to quieten the bitterness he held over what had been revealed to him.</p>
<p class=vb>Innocent or not, responsible or not… The fact remained that this conversation had gone far beyond the context of an informant giving him intel of disasters to come. This had become a personal matter; this conversation had become far too personal for having been delivered to him by a complete stranger. So he continued with extreme gravity:</p>
<p class=vb>“Just as it would be normal for me to ask how you could know so much, and expect to obtain a satisfactory answer to my questions.” Faced with such implacable logic, the little being gulped once again with anguish and anticipation; but the young professor did not let the silence last for much longer, and added almost immediately: “…That is, if only you had the slightest idea yourself.”</p>
<p class=vb>For perhaps the very first time since they had arrived in his apartment, their stillness had suddenly become perfect and absolute. Contrary to what had become the usual sight, their body had seemed to freeze like marble, if only for a brief moment. The archaeologist preferred not to dwell on this observation, and instead continued the thread of his deductions.</p>
<p class=vb>“It sounds completely absurd, but what you have been telling me is that you can remember what might have happened under other circumstances, as well as events that already have; but that you cannot remember <i>how</i> you learned about them in the first place,” he stated heavily. Clay looked like they were about to claim their innocence once again, but he held up a hand and silently gestured them that they no longer needed to justify themselves. “For now, let’s turn a blind eye to this inconsistency. Instead of focusing on what you cannot remember, I suggest we start solely from what you know, and then try to draw a logical path from there. Does this sound reasonable to you?”</p>
<p class=vs>They opened their mouth and blinked in astonishment, staring at him as if they thought they had misunderstood. However, when the archaeologist gave them in return the faintest hints of a pained smile, Clay understood that they no longer had to fear his anger—an anger that they still considered to be entirely justified. But now, they understood that all he sought from this point onwards, was simply a true cooperation as equals, without animosity.</p>
<p class=vb>Clay still felt too surprised and intimidated to answer; but they expressed their agreement with a shy nod. The man acknowledged their reply and nodded in turn.</p>
<p class=vb>“Very well,” he said slowly, trying as best he could to hide his apprehension. “When you think of my brother… It seems to me that what you actually intended to talk about was rather his current life, as well as his future. What exactly do you remember about this?”</p>
<p class=vs>“It’s… There was this case, when you met him. You investigated together once, and it was during that case that he talked about… your common past, and what happened to him during the time you were apart.</p>
<p class=vb>“I know very little about him. But when you met… His wife and daughter had already been dead for many years. He didn’t say when or how it happened, but… They were killed by the same organization that abducted your parents.”</p>
<p class=vb>A heavy silence befell the living room. Hearing the news, the archaeologist’s face darkened. He no longer needed to ask why Clay thought that his brother was going to need help; and perhaps this debacle would even lead them deeper than to simply assist him. Was he possibly going to see his biological parents again? He… He was unsure how he should react to such a thought. He felt that he still needed time to come to terms with the idea that he had been adopted, and that… that he apparently was the only one who had forgotten.</p>
<p class=vb>“I don’t know when exactly it happened,” the shapeshifter continued. “For all I know, maybe it won’t happen before a few more years… or maybe it’s already too late.”</p>
<p class=vb>They seemed to hesitate for a moment, as if wondering whether or not they should share one more detail; but in the end, they continued on a slightly different topic.</p>
<p class=vb>“Of course, the other cases I mentioned had terrible consequences too, if not worse ones; but we have more than five years to get prepared for those. And besides, you’re the one who solved them last time!”</p>
<p class=vb>The archaeologist recoiled sharply, blinking in surprise.</p>
<p class=vb>“Wait… <i>All</i> the disasters you mentioned, was I…?”</p>
<p class=vb>“Of <i>course</i> it was thanks to you that the worst has been avoided!” they exclaimed with childish wonder, eyes sparkling with admiration. “You even saved the world when those golems attacked! Why else did you think I’d ask <i>you</i> for help? Since you’re here and we’re so far ahead, I’m not worried.”</p>
<p class=vb>This was… He needed several long seconds just to take in such news. True, he had helped Scotland Yard here and there with minor little investigations, true, he had already faced a hostile environment during his adventure in Akbadain—he once again felt a twinge in his heart as he once again remembered just how badly said adventure had ended. But… saving entire cities? Saving the <i>world</i>? Surely, these tales had been embellished and sprinkled with fancy exaggerations…</p>
<p class=vb>The little being’s gaze dropped again, and they grabbed the edge of their chair with childish guilt before adding in a small voice:</p>
<p class=vs>“Sorry if I’m, uh… ruining the mystery for you. I thought it was more important to warn you so you could do something before it’s too late. You always managed to find the truth on your own, and you were usually able to stop the culprits, but… Most of the time, the damage had already been done.</p>
<p class=vb>“As for your brother… It was far too late when you saw him again. Where we stand today… I don’t know how long we have before it happens.”</p>
<p class=vb>Once again, he had to take a deep breath. But soon, he nodded gravely.</p>
<p class=vb>“What about this ‘common past’?” he asked. “What exactly do you know about it?”</p>
<p class=vb>“I know your parents were kidnapped by Targent—that’s the name of their organization—and I know what happened when the Laytons came to adopt you. But… that’s it,” they whispered with a desperate and guilty sigh.</p>
<p class=vb>“So in fact, you don’t really have any precise knowledge of this time period?” he frowned in surprise. “You only know what he would have said about it at the time, but nothing else?”</p>
<p class=vs>If so, this did not explain how they could have replicated what his brother used to look like as a child; but he reluctantly remembered that he himself had imposed to temporarily keep a blind eye on such a massive and disconcerting inconsistency.</p>
<p class=vb>Clay nodded sadly, well aware of this exact problem.</p>
<p class=vb>“The fact that you know so much would lead one to believe that you had to be present at the time of these events, if only during the time of these ‘cases’ that… that I would have solved,” the young professor announced. “Accounting for everything that you seem to know about us personally, I don’t see what else it could be. And yet… Could it be that you have another explanation?”</p>
<p class=vb>Clay always spoke of these events as if they had been nothing but an outsider witness. It was always a matter of <i>‘you’</i>, of <i>‘they’</i>… but never a matter of <i>‘I’</i>.</p>
<p class=vb>The child looked down sheepishly, still scratching the surface of their black pouch with great hesitation. One more time; one time too many.</p>
<p class=vs>Every time Clay felt nervous, or tried to avoid answering one of their questions; every time, without exception, their gaze was focused on this item. As if… As if this pouch contained the real answers to all the questions that Claire and him had been asking; real answers which had hitherto been both so implausible and so unbearable to hear; justifying at the same time the apparent incompatibility between Clay’s sincere desire to cooperate, and their prolonged, reluctant silence.</p>
<p class=vb>As if, despite its small size, this pouch was spacious enough to contain all the information that the child had obviously only just begun to reveal. So much information, including certainly photographs since they knew the faces of several people, at several stages of their respective lives, which came from several times separated by several decades… All of this, gathered within such a small volume? This seemed impossible to him.</p>
<p class=vs>It seemed far more logical to him to think that this pouch was perhaps only one among many others, and that it could only contain a small fraction of all this knowledge.</p>
<p class=vs>It seemed reasonable to him to think that, for one reason or another, for an unknown purpose which he could not possibly fathom, personal information related to him and his surroundings had been collected and stored, and that Clay had been granted access to the contents of all these archives before arriving in his home. That this pouch would keep information of paramount importance, perhaps even posing a great danger if it were to fall in the wrong hands…</p>
<p class=vb>It seemed obvious to him that, if this pouch was only one among many others, then it was the only one that they had been able to keep. But then, where were the others? Forgotten in a future era that no longer existed? Destroyed or lost during the time travel? Left somewhere in this world, ready to be picked up by the first comer?</p>
<p class=vb>In any case, there he had the answer to his question: yes. There was indeed another explanation, and contrary to appearances, it was not necessary that Clay had been an eyewitness to every event they had retold. Perhaps they had been a witness to some of them, since they seemed to know them on a relatively personal level, and not just as someone who would have heard of him by reading the <i>London Times</i>. But in this case, in which of these events had they participated? The young professor felt unable to decipher whether this reduced the number of possible identities, or instead increased it considerably.</p>
<p class=vb>To his surprise, this time, Clay did not eternally remain silent.</p>
<p class=vb>“You’re… You’re right,” they finally admitted with a heavy, painful sigh. “Everything I know, I had to have learned it from <i>somewhere</i>.” They glared at the small pouch. “I… I <i>think</i> I might have learned it from this,” they added as they consciously tapped its surface a few more times with an accusatory finger. “But… The problem is that I don’t know where ‘this’ comes from. I’m not even sure I really know what it is… So in a way, I really don’t know where I got all these memories from, let alone those about your early childhood.”</p>
<p class=vb>His eyes widened in surprise and sudden suspicion.</p>
<p class=vb>“Why did you say <i>‘memories’</i>? Haven’t we established that you were not physically present during this specific event?”</p>
<p class=vs>The child started, a great shiver running down their spine. Evidently, he was getting closer to his goal, and was finally about to lift the veil on the actual core of the issue.</p>
<p class=vb>Clay raised their head and stared at him with a terrified look; this reaction only led him to frown even more in response.</p>
<p class=vb>“I swear I don’t know how to explain it,” they stammered in a flat, shaky voice. “I know I wasn’t present. But I have these pictures in mind… It’s as if I were there, but I <i>know</i> I wasn’t.”</p>
<p class=vb>The archaeologist sat up slowly, surely without realising it, and once again raised a confused but very attentive hand to his chin. Clay flinched and squeezed their eyelids shut, lowering their head vigorously and clutching their skull from both sides. The blue cap began to change colour and gain height, but their head shook even more, and the misshapen hybrid between a blue cap and a brown top hat sank, then disappeared somewhere in the middle of a moving puddle of light brown hair. Their eyes started glimmering.</p>
<p class=vb>“You are an intelligent and rational man. What I just said makes absolutely no sense. If I can’t believe it myself, how could I ever hope to convince you that it’s the truth?”</p>
<p class=vb>For once, it was his turn to lower his gaze. He now understood much better where their entire behaviour had come from. Indeed… He hardly knew what to do with such assertions; and had Clay pronounced these exact same words as soon as they had met and first been inquired about their origins, he would have been even more sceptical than he already was in this moment.</p>
<p class=vb>“At the very least, give me the chance to judge this for myself,” he retorted with as much softness as he could give in his current state of mind. “It is true that what you just said is very difficult to believe on its own; but if you can share more information, it could clarify your perspective and work in your favour.”</p>
<p class=vb>Their head shyly peeked over their trembling arms. For the first time, the young professor saw tears running down their cheeks; his face tensed all the more in response. He tried to ignore the fact that those two thin translucent streaks of liquid somehow seemed to disappear and dry up once they would reach below their chin, rather than let gravity work normally and stain their red sweater with salty water drops. This was certainly another… peculiarity related to their new condition.</p>
<p class=vb>“What you described… ‘pictures,’ you said,” he repeated cautiously. “Are you talking about real memories, or about something else?”</p>
<p class=vb>His only response was a sniffle, a shrug, and an uncertain pout. In other words: they had no idea.</p>
<p class=vb>“I’m not sure… Ever since I arrived in the lab, I’ve been trying to figure out what they meant. When I saw Claire, the experiment, when I saw you, and saw how you reacted when I talked about your brother… I understood that they were telling the truth.”</p>
<p class=vb>“You weren’t sure of this from the start?” he frowned in surprise.</p>
<p class=vb>Another shrug, both preceded and followed by a long hesitation.</p>
<p class=vb>“It’s hard to explain, but… I feel like something’s wrong with those memories. Given everything that happened today, we have proof that some of the events they describe really took place; so it makes sense to think that the others are real too, or that they would have happened in the future if I hadn’t been there. But…”</p>
<p class=vb>Their sentence remained forever unfinished. After this one orphaned word had fallen silent, it took them a long time before they gulped heavily, tried to swallow back their tears, and finally spoke again to share their final conclusion.</p>
<p class=vb>“There are only two things I’m sure of. They’re real; and they’re not mine.”</p>
<p class=vb>There was a great silence. For a few seconds that felt like an eternity, the archaeologist forgot to breathe.</p>
<p class=vb>“I can’t stand the fact that I can remember things like this so clearly, and yet that I can’t recall anything else. It’s not fair that I can know the details of someone else’s life just like that. And it doesn’t even make any sense!”</p>
<p class=vb>Clay had known him all along. They had advanced and extremely precise knowledge of not only strange and fanciful cases that he would have allegedly solved in a hypothetical future, but also knowledge of his own intimate past. When they were led to accidentally shape-shift while they had not been given a specific identity to take, they had on several occasions had a certain tendency to take on the appearance of a Hershel Layton replica who looked consistently older.</p>
<p class=vb>“It’s as if someone else’s memories had been condensed and then crammed directly into my head. I don’t know <i>how</i>, I don’t know <i>why</i>, I don’t know <i>who</i> could’ve done that—”</p>
<p class=vb>He did not feel the need to ask who those memories might have originally belonged to.</p>
<p class=vb>He too had started shaking. Was this really possible? What means could have possibly been employed in order to set up such a thing? And if so, was this little pouch somehow related to the process? For the second time that day, he felt his blood boil with a carefully controlled, but intense rage.</p>
<p class=vs>He shared a look with the child, who once again curled up on themselves in fear and shame; but this time, they were not his target.</p>
<p class=vb>Clay shared his anger. There was no point in directing his toward someone who understood him and agreed with him.</p>
<p class=vb>“Would you—Out of everything that you can remember—Do you think that it would be possible to develop a technology that could do <i>exactly</i> what you just described?”</p>
<p class=vb>He had to wait quite a handful of painfully long seconds before obtaining an answer: given the bewildered face of his interlocutor, it was apparent that they needed some time just to even process the fact that he had, in fact, been convinced.</p>
<p class=vb>“I don’t know,” they finally answered with little confidence in their words. “But… It’s true that you’ve seen stranger than that. I guess… Wait, actually that does vaguely ring a bell, now that I think about it. But where did you…?”</p>
<p class=vs>The archaeologist took this answer as a definitive <i>yes</i>, and he needed to get up from his seat so he could expel his surplus of emotions in a form other than ungentlemanly words. His chin nervously clamped between index and thumb, his face contorted and occupied with taking long breaths in a vain attempt to regain his composure, he began to pace rapidly in the middle of his living room, thinking intensely.</p>
<p class=vb>Clay remained seated. Their feet dangled nervously under the chair, far above the wooden floor.</p>
<p class=vb>“If it can reassure you, even if just a little… I don’t think I have <i>all</i> of your memories,” they announced gravely. “All that comes to mind are your adventures, and… Just a memory or two like the one about your brother. But that’s it.”</p>
<p class=vs>If it truly were the case, then this only increased the chances that such a contraption could have indeed existed; and more than that, it opened up the possibility that he actually <i>had</i> dealt with it at some point, during this infamous and ever so mysterious future that no longer existed. If those memories, which were not even their own, were incomplete; then who could possibly say that they truly had information regarding every single case his future self had solved, without any exception?</p>
<p class=vs>Not only that, but if the purpose of such a machine had been to steal, or at least copy a person’s memories, and then force them into someone else’s mind… Perhaps here was the real ultimate reason behind Clay’s amnesia and elusive personality. Someone had outright tried to rewrite their memory, if not their entire sense of self; it went without saying that nobody could come out unscathed from such an experience.</p>
<p class=vb>Evidently, if the goal had been to copy his memories, or even his entire personality, then the process had been a failure: Clay had been able to recognise that this knowledge was not theirs.</p>
<p class=vs>In a nutshell, this whole mystery… was that someone must have taken the memories of a Hershel Layton who would have originated from about ten years in his future, that someone had given them to Clay, whether willingly or unwillingly, and that they had then been sent to their past, at the time of Claire’s time travel experiment, only to stop it from taking place. And he was not even getting started with the list of haphazard hypotheses they had come up with in hopes of explaining their physics-defying shape-shifting.</p>
<p class=vb>Ockham’s razor had better watch out.</p>
<p class=vb>As for this pouch, it was likely that it contained information relating to his life, whether in the traditional form of paper and ink, or in a more unusual form; and quite honestly, even though he did not know whether or not this assumption was entirely true, what he did know was that <i>he did not want to know</i>. The longer this pouch remained closed, safe in his apartment, and out of sight, the better he would feel.</p>
<p class=vb>“Even though we don’t know the circumstances, what we can be sure of is that you were in contact with the person who would have taken my memories, and then given them to you,” he eventually deduced. “If those memories are the only thing you can remember, and that you forgot everything about your own identity in return…”</p>
<p class=vb>He preferred to not finish his sentence. The idea he had in mind was nothing more than a hypothesis without any evidence; and if it turned out to be false, then sharing it with this amnesiac and lost individual would have only made matters worse, and burdened their psyche with unnecessary doubts.</p>
<p class=vs>Could it be that the person responsible for this chaos, and the time traveller themselves, were actually one and the same? It seemed unlikely that someone who would have set up such madness would not have wished to come to the past in person, if only to ensure that their plan was proceeding as they intended.</p>
<p class=vs>Perhaps the motivation behind this project had been the same one that Clay had already expressed: preventing various tragedies from the past through the use of knowledge from the future.</p>
<p class=vs>However… Even if Clay had at any point been responsible for this situation, he had no doubt that it no longer was the case. Whether it was to be taken in the physical or philosophical sense, Clay and the culprit behind this case were different people.</p>
<p class=vb>As for their true identity, since in the end they had never been required to witness <i>anything</i>, since they only ever had to be present at a single, very precise moment in order to receive these memories, then travel through time…</p>
<p class=vb>Apart from Claire and himself, Clay could be absolutely anyone.</p>
<p class=vb>It took him a while longer, but he eventually realised that he had left his last sentence hanging, and that his interlocutor had been staring at him with curiosity and impatience ever since. He had decided not to bother them with such a grim assumption; so he decided to subtly derive from the subject.</p>
<p class=vb>“…Our fingerprints prove that you are neither Claire, nor me,” he summed up with a short, tense sigh. “That’s all we know for certain.”</p>
<p class=vb>He closed his eyes and massaged his tired face; then he turned back to the amnesiac stranger with a gaze suffused with a carpet of emotions that he himself could not fully identify. Sadness, pity, despair…</p>
<p class=vb>“I’m sorry I can’t do more than this at the moment,” he added with a heavy sense of finality.</p>
<p class=vb>“No, don’t worry about it,” they replied instantly, shaking their head from side to side. “You have… Just the fact that you trust me is… It’s already a lot for me. Thank you.”</p>
<p class=vb>Trust… For some reason that pinched his heart, he found this word incredibly painful. He had trusted his parents, after all. He had known them all his life, they had lived together until he became independent enough to have his own apartment; or at least, this was what he had thought. And now, instead of his own family, it was a stranger, who might not even have had a single connection with him at any point in their life, who had come and revealed to him the truth behind his own birth.</p>
<p class=vb>Did he want to trust a complete stranger, when he evidently could not even trust his own parents?</p>
<p class=vb>The front door opened abruptly.</p>
<p class=vb>“Hershel, Clay, I have good news! The universe is not in imminent danger.”</p>
<p class=vs>The archaeologist, seeing Claire arrive, turned towards her in one swift move, and only had eyes for the room she had just left.</p>
<p class=vb>Too distracted to notice, the scientist immediately turned to the small amnesiac entity.</p>
<p class=vb>“According to Dimitri… If your actions on the course of time had had consequences other than your current condition, then we would have already noticed them by now,” she explained with a strange mixture between gravity and relief. “I am not fully at ease just yet, but… It seems <i>for now</i> that we are not risking much by tampering with History a little more, in the end.”</p>
<p class=vb>The child’s face burst with a large smile sparkling with joy and mischief, and they discreetly threw a small fist in the air, whispering a short cry of victory.</p>
<p class=vb>“<i>However</i>, I do insist that we keep an eye on this whole time travel affair, and that we proceed with utmost caution. We have other, more thorough experiments to run that will hopefully shed more light on the situation. And as for you, Clay, we will need to go back to the lab and try to figure out what happened to you.”</p>
<p class=vb>In barely a second, their expression was mirrored vertically. Still, after some quick thinking, they decided that it was in their interest to agree. She had mentioned laboratories and experiments as if they were about to become a guinea pig; but they knew better than to believe that she would treat them as such.</p>
<p class=vb>Claire finally realised that, as she was talking, her boyfriend had silently walked toward her—or rather, toward the path to the front door that she was inadvertently blocking. Her eyes widened when she saw the state he was in: she had only been away for about twenty minutes, and now his face was so wrinkled with anguish, that he seemed to have gained five entire decades.</p>
<p class=vb>“My apologies,” she babbled nervously, “I should have warned before coming back and… I interrupted you in the middle of an important conversation, didn’t I?”</p>
<p class=vb>Her boyfriend gave a small start, now that he had been abruptly pulled from his thoughts. He looked at her with a puzzled and confused look, then completely came back to reality.</p>
<p class=vb>“Ah… Sorry, Claire, I didn’t mean to startle you. Everything is… I’m fine. But if you don’t mind, since the phone is now available again… I would like to have a word with my parents.”</p>
<p class=vs>And without waiting for anyone’s response, he rushed out of the room, grabbed the receiver, and closed the door behind him.</p>
<p class=vb>The woman continued to stare in shock at the closed door for many, many long seconds.</p>
<p class=vb>“…What did I miss?”</p>
<p class=vb>Clay’s only response was to stare at the wooden floor, at the puddle of tea glinting off a late September setting sun, and at the fragments of a broken china cup; then to give a heavy, wordless shrug.</p>
