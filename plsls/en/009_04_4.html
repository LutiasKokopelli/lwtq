<p class=vb>Claire had spent enough time in this flat to know where to find a broom and mop.</p>
<p class=vs>Evidently, something awful had occurred during her absence. No matter what Clay could have possibly said, it had upset Hershel to such an extent that he had… The thought alone was breaking her heart.</p>
<p class=vb>He was so fond of his tea set. What a tragedy.</p>
<p class=vb>In over five years of friendship, never had she met the misfortune of seeing him in such a state. If learning that she had almost died—no, that she <i>had</i> died originally, and should have remained as such—had already been a huge shock for her and him alike… She did not dare imagine what could have shaken him so.</p>
<p class=vb>In search of answers, she had naturally turned to the only person left who could provide them. The person in question must have also changed their appearance several times while she was away, and it now seemed that they were not even trying to copy their models faithfully anymore. She thought she could still vaguely recognise the same face of that teenage version of Luke Triton that they had introduced earlier, but the features had since been warped, giving a face even more boyish and plump than it already had been, a jumper that now sported a bright red colour instead of its original dull blue, and a now missing cap. She judged it was a safe bet to assume that even more changes had occurred within details she did not bother to look for.</p>
<p class=vs>As for what had happened during her conversation with Dimitri, they had told her with a small, sheepish voice, that it was probably fairer to let the ‘professor’ talk about it in person and of his own free will, because it involved some very personal matters for him. This had only increased the number of questions in her mind (<i>If it really is this personal, how could you possibly know about it?</i>); but this time, she understood perfectly the intention behind their silence, and she had therefore agreed to wait patiently for her boyfriend’s return—and to wait even more if he preferred to remain silent for a while longer.</p>
<p class=vb>Poor Hershel had the unfortunate tendency to never want to share his worries, so as to not bother his friends; and she, along with the friends in question, had had the greatest difficulty in helping him open up and blossom little by little. After so many years of hard work spent trying to carefully pull him out of his shell, it was out of the question to see him scurry back into it.</p>
<p class=vs>Once out of the kitchen and back into the living room, she saw to her horror that Clay was kneeling on the floor in front of the crime scene, and had already started picking up the debris with their bare hands. Nearly losing her grip on the utensils she had brought, she called out to them in distress—only to notice less than a second later that the damage had already been done, and that they already held numerous fragments of china in their hands.</p>
<p class=vb>Miraculously, and to her utter bewilderment, she saw not a single wound. The sharp pieces were carelessly heaped together and seemed ready to flay their skin in many places; and yet, she could not find the slightest trace of their path. It appeared that each cut was ready to close and merge back together as soon as the blade that had tore it had moved away.</p>
<p class=vb>The little shape-shifter looked up at her in surprise and confusion, asking her about the source of her distress. She found herself unable to formulate the right words to explain that, had they still been a human being with a normal metabolism, their hands should currently be covered in their own blood. She knew not whether she should be more surprised by the fact that, once again, their strange condition had protected them from a second tragedy… or by the fact that they had yet to comprehend the obvious nature of the danger they were facing in this very moment.</p>
<p class=vb>How was it possible for someone to possess information related to the most intricate secrets of her boyfriend’s personal life… and all at the same time, to lack such primordial knowledge regarding the dangerousness of shards of glass and similar materials against the soft, fragile skin of a human hand? Wasn’t this one of the first things that every single child in existence was taught as early as they could comprehend it, and one of the most obvious laws of everyday life to everyone else?</p>
<p class=vb>“I’m sorry…” they murmured with shame and remorse. “It’s my fault if it broke. I should be the one to clean this up.”</p>
<p class=vb>Claire closed her eyes, tightened her grip around the broom, and let out a long sigh.</p>
<p class=vb>“…Let me at least show you how it should be done.”</p>
<h2>September 28, 1953<br>05:13 PM<div class=hr></div></h2>
<p class=vb>It took him four attempts before he was finally able to dial his parents’ number.</p>
<p class=vs>The first was aborted when he had an unexpected moment of forgetfulness and accidentally dialled the number of their old home in Stansbury, rather than that of their London flat.</p>
<p class=vs>The second was interrupted when the image of his brother appeared in his mind again, causing him to start daydreaming as he tried to imagine what he might look like now, more than twenty years later; and as a result, lost track of where he was in the number sequence.</p>
<p class=vb>The third was a failure because of his trembling finger, and he swore that the numbers were as much to blame as he was, for his seething eyes saw them cloudy and dancing, as if they were mocking him.</p>
<p class=vs>He had been adopted. He had parents other than those who had raised him, and he had a brother. Of all the possible ways to learn such world-shaking news, he had learned it from a complete stranger of dubious origins, amnesiac and possessor of <i>his own memories</i>, who was a faceless and shape-shifting mess, who had somehow come from the future, and who had nothing to do with his personal life; and this, before learning it instead from someone who was <i>actually</i> involved and personally close to him, such as, for example, <i>his own family</i>.</p>
<p class=vb>The fact that this child had heard the news before him, that he was by far the last to learn such fundamental information about his own life, he who was supposedly <i>the</i> most involved since it touched upon his own intimacy and identity… Such an injustice was enough to shake even the most perfect of all gentlemen.</p>
<p class=vs>The repetitive and mechanical ringing finally fell silent, and he heard the voice of Lucille Layton; the one he had always believed to be his mother, and whom he would continue to call as such in spite of everything… But also the one who had always hidden from him a secret as fundamental as the fact that there existed other members of his family, and that he had never had the chance to see them again.</p>
<p class=vb>He greeted her nervously and swiftly; then, unable to think of any transition, he shook his head sharply and took a deep breath.</p>
<p class=vb>“Ma, I will not beat around the bush. Do I have a brother?”</p>
<p class=vb>There was a dead silence. After several more long seconds, he heard his father’s voice in the distance, muttering something which vaguely resembled <i>“I told you he’d have to find out someday.”</i> He buried his face in a trembling hand, and a long sigh escaped him.</p>
<p class=vb>“I will take that as a yes,” he groaned painfully.</p>
<p class=vb>There were a few short, disjointed noises. When he heard his father’s voice more distinctly rather than his mother’s, he deduced that she had handed over the receiver.</p>
<p class=vb>“…You were too young to remember it clearly, and we thought it was unnecessary to address,” Roland admitted with a heavy heart. “But evidently, you weren’t young enough to have completely forgotten.”</p>
<p class=vs>Oh, the irony. Yes, of course. He had remembered his earliest years by himself, all on his own, without anybody’s assistance, absolutely not. What a crazy idea that he would have learned it <i>by chance</i>, from a <i>complete stranger</i>, rather than by having <i>deduced it on his own</i>. He could solve other people’s cases in a breeze, help Scotland Yard to shed light on many mysteries of both the mundane and the extraordinary; surely, solving the riddle of his own life would have been child’s play in comparison. Right?</p>
<p class=vb>He took a deep breath, trying as best he could to contain his emotions.</p>
<p class=vb>“You thought it was <i>unnecessary</i> to address the fact that I had another family, for… How long has it been? Almost twenty-five years?”</p>
<p class=vs>Quite honestly, he no longer had the energy to maintain any subtlety in his words. It was a good thing that Claire was not here to hear him, because she would probably have been disappointed by his lack of tactfulness.</p>
<p class=vb>He heard a faint <i>“June 1929, you were three years old”</i> in the distance. Shortly after, a loud, strained sigh from his father sounded from across the line.</p>
<p class=vb>“Listen, son… Everything we’ve done, we always did with your happiness as our only goal. But the truth is that the world… is not as peaceful as we would like it to be. We wanted to spare you from this, but…” There was a heavy sigh. “You’re right. You’re old enough to be in the know, and… Ah, I suppose it was only a matter of time before you got involved somehow. While we’re at it, it’s best not to have you jump into the lion’s den without knowing what you’re getting yourself into.”</p>
<p class=vb>“<i>Roland</i>!” his wife snarled with a particularly intense panic. “Surely you’re not telling him to— Have you lost your mind!? Hershel, it’s far too dangerous. Please, no matter what you do, stay safe. Don’t try to face them, you don’t stand a chance!”</p>
<p class=vb>…He had to admit that he had not at all expected the conversation to take such a turn. What adventure, what danger, what people were they talking about? He was not sure he understood. Or rather… Now that he remembered what Clay had told him regarding the fate of his brother’s new family, he refused to understand.</p>
<p class=vb>“What if they wiretapped us…! Oh, Roland, what should we do? Is it already too late?”</p>
<p class=vb>“Lucille, they’re not hearing any of this. Calm down. I disassembled the phone last night, everything was normal.”</p>
<p class=vb>Realising that this had to be a routine action and that his father <i>regularly</i> checked that they were not being spied on, he felt faint. Indeed, he had <i>absolutely not</i> anticipated that such a conspiracy could go this far.</p>
<p class=vb>Hearing such words, imagining that his father had been doing this for many years, long before he had moved out of their home and into his own flat, made him dizzy. His mother always worried whenever he or his father were late getting home; his father always trying to dismiss her worries, to convince him that she was just being overprotective of them and that there was nothing to worry about; and himself, always taking his father’s side, because he never suspected that her anxieties might have been justified even once… How could he be so blind?</p>
<p class=vs>He remembered that time, when he was still in high school, when they still lived in the small village of Stansbury, when she was particularly hysterical: mentioning that his father had gone off with men in dark suits, that these men were looking for ‘Hershel’ without giving an explicit reason why or even explaining how they could know him.</p>
<p class=vs>He had met his father near the ruins at the east of the village, and as usual he had been told that Lucille was worrying too much; that these men were archaeologists who wanted to see the wall of Norwell, nothing more; that they had met him once when he was a baby, and that they were just curious to see how he had grown. That he should forget this whole thing, and that she should stop making such a fuss over any and everything.</p>
<p class=vb>He had never seen what these men looked like, so he had, as always, trusted his father over his mother, and imagined that her fears had caused her to greatly exaggerate the description of the strangers that she had given him.</p>
<p class=vb>He felt unable to judge whether he was right to revisit this memory, and so many others like it that were now coming back to him, with a new, wary and critical eye; or whether, like his mother, he had begun to sink completely into an exacerbated paranoia. Whatever the case, the fact was that the danger was there; that his parents had known about it for decades; and that, in order to keep him as carefree and normal as possible, they had both done their best to ensure that he would never suspect any of it.</p>
<p class=vb>He finally began to realise the size of the hornet’s nest he had gotten himself into.</p>
<p class=vb>“I believe you… owe me a lot of explanations,” he stammered with great struggle and restraint, and very little breath.</p>
<p class=vb>There was a great silence; then another sigh from his father.</p>
<p class=vb>“Yes, Hershel. We do.”</p>
<p class=vs>For perhaps the first time since the phone call began, the son was glad that the silence returned so quickly, and lasted so long. With his head bubbling and buried in his free hand, his lungs on the verge of suffocation, his body filled with an icy chill, he welcomed with open arms the time he had been granted to put his thoughts in some kind of order.</p>
<p class=vb>Finally, his mother spoke again with great reluctance.</p>
<p class=vb>“Your birth father had some rather… unsavoury friends.”</p>
<p class=vb>“They must have been former colleagues rather than ‘friends’, considering what they’ve become,” Roland said bitterly.</p>
<p class=vb>“You lived in the neighbouring village. We never had the opportunity to meet your parents before they disappeared, we only had rumours; but this was what let us know that you and your brother needed help. Not only had you been orphaned… but you also needed protection from those brutes.”</p>
<p class=vb>The very same ‘brutes’ who had, or would one day, track down his brother and decimate the family he had founded.</p>
<p class=vb>“We couldn’t afford to adopt you both,” she lamented with a guilt that was still quite audible, and whose weight seemed to have constantly grown with the years, without ever giving her any real respite. “Fortunately, the Sycamores arrived soon after to take care of your brother. But still… It is true that we should not have separated you.”</p>
<p class=vb>Sycamore… So here was his new name; assuming he had not changed it again since.</p>
<p class=vb>“Do you know why our parents were abducted?” he asked slowly.</p>
<p class=vb>“Not in detail,” his mother sighed, “but… According to the rumours, it was related to their profession.”</p>
<p class=vb>“The Azran.”</p>
<p class=vb>Roland Layton had imposed this name into the conversation with gravity, very well aware of the heavy weight it carried. Whether he thought his wife had forgotten, or whether she had deliberately chosen to omit this detail, the fact was that he had judged this information important enough to be addressed.</p>
<p class=vb>“As far as I know, you haven’t been interested in the Azran since… since Stansbury,” he continued. “Fortunately, it seems to be the only thing they’re interested in, and that they leave the other archaeologists alone.”</p>
<p class=vs>The Azran… Only a decade ago, and even to this day, the very existence of this ancient civilisation was up for debate. Sources contradicted each other, some claiming that they never existed, others arguing that they once dominated the entire planet. The evidence for their existence was both indisputable, and yet difficult to interpret; the community’s excitement at the mere thought of making discoveries about them was enormous, and yet compared to the interest in the field, publications that did so little as to mention them by name must have numbered in the hundreds at most.</p>
<p class=vs>Donald Rutledge’s <i>Ancient Histories</i> was the only book that managed to collect and index archaeological sites, artefacts, and some translations of Azran texts, and everyone took it as the book everyone had to refer to; and yet, it had been published many decades ago, and many of the arguments made by its author had long since become at best haphazard and incomplete, at worst completely obsolete and refuted by the more thorough work of his successors, such as palaeontologist Doris Pompitious.</p>
<p class=vb>He had never paid attention until that very moment; but now that he was already questioning his entire life, all he had to do was hear that a specific word was a clue related to his personal puzzle, and he would instantly begin to see additional secrets between the lines, and danger in every corner.</p>
<p class=vb>The fact was that such a situation was undoubtedly suspicious. Perhaps he was really digging too deep and, like his mother, imagining the worst; but the fact that the world could know so much about the Azran, but also so little… All this suggested that large amounts of information had been hidden from the general public, and even from the archaeological community as a whole. As if… as if some members of the very same archaeological community were consciously and actively limiting publications and preventing research about them from being pursued by anyone who would be foreign to their inner circle.</p>
<p class=vb>As his father had said, he had not been interested in this civilisation ever since they had left Stansbury and moved to London, ten years earlier; this was certainly the reason why he had never noticed such an inconsistency, however blatant. But no, since Stansbury, since that horrible adventure in the ruins of Akbadain… He had much preferred to avoid hearing about it more than necessary, and had even secretly wished that he could forget its existence altogether. Given his studies and his profession, he had done what was strictly necessary in order to stay up to date, of course… But he had always preferred to research subjects as far away from those ruins as possible.</p>
<p class=vs>His new career choice had already been a heavy burden to carry, and he had not… He did not have the courage to go any further. Stealing his career was already pushing it; could he really afford to take over his favourite research subject as well? It wasn’t as if he could have asked what Randall would have thought of it.</p><p class=vs>Would he have been happy and proud, boastful even, to see that he had, albeit in a very ironic and tragic way, finally succeeded in making an archaeologist out of him? Would he have instead preferred being given the chance to live his dream and become famous himself? And therefore, would he have been offended if the man who had seen him fall into that bottomless pit were now to make great discoveries in his place?</p><p class=vs>He had wanted to honour his memory. But even ten years later… He was still unsure what the best way to do so could possibly be.</p>
<p class=vs>And so, in doubt… He had only done things halfway. He had tried to fulfil one of his best friend’s last wishes; but he had refused to pave a path to a glory that did not belong to him. The Azran… This was Randall’s discovery, not his.</p>
<p class=vb>To this day, he had yet to hear about a single archaeological team who would have managed to find the treasure he had seen at the heart of the Akbadain ruins, and then published a scientific article about their discovery: and even ten years later, his decision to not reveal its existence and write such a paper himself was unwavering. If these ruins and their treasure had been found by others since then, it had probably been so by people who were more interested in the number of zeroes that the gold would add to the rightmost part of their bank account balance, than in those required to describe the thousands of millenia that had passed since their forging.</p>
<p class=vs>Who would have thought that a seventeen-year-old high school student would have been able to decipher the markings on the wall of Norwell to the east of their village, where everyone else had failed for a good thirty years before giving up entirely? That, far from being satisfied with such an already revolutionary discovery, he would have followed the wall’s directions, found the legendary Mask of Chaos, deciphered the inscriptions written inside of that freshly unearthed artefact and traced the map it contained, then located one of the greatest Azran sites ever imagined to date—and all this, entirely by himself?</p>
<p class=vs>Who would have thought that this same high school student, this unstoppable genius, could have single-handedly solved this incredible puzzle in the span of just a few months; and yet, at the same time, believe that in order to explore these ruins, it would be enough to dive into them out of the blue, armed with only a friend, a lunch for two, and an old shovel, expecting to be back in time for dinner?</p>
<p class=vb>And how could this same friend let himself be convinced that nothing would… that everything would be… that he would be able to protect him to the end…?</p>
<p class=vs>The handle of the receiver cracked slightly, protesting against his clenched fingers; but he did not loosen his grip. For a change, it was easy for him not to let go.</p>
<p class=vb>Well, this was what he was trying to tell himself, and yet just today… Once again, he had let go off something dear to him, and lost it forever.</p>
<p class=vb>“It was a risky choice to let you study archaeology, but after… After what happened in Stansbury, we didn’t have the heart to talk you out of it.”</p>
<p class=vb>It was his mother’s voice that brought him back to reality, and reminded him that he was supposed to be asking them for vital information about an entirely different and unrelated tragedy.</p>
<p class=vb>“Fortunately,” she continued, “when you told us about what you were studying at university, we were reassured. This Dr. Schrader… If he encourages his students to focus their research on fossils rather than ancient civilisations, it means that he can be trusted.”</p>
<p class=vb>She had uttered these words with the intent of soothing him; yet, far on the contrary, a cold shiver ran through him. He did not like at all what her words were accidentally implying.</p>
<p class=vb>“<i>Andrew as well!?</i>” he choked.</p>
<p class=vs>No. He had to remain calm and rational. There always was the possibility that, this time, he had reached too hasty a conclusion, that he had misinterpreted his mother’s words, that his mentor had nothing to do with this insanity, that he had no reason to doubt him; but…</p>
<p class=vb>Silence had fallen once again.</p>
<p class=vb>Of course. Of <i>course</i>.</p>
<p class=vb>Was there a <i>single person</i> in his life he could count on to have a <i>normal</i> life, and not keep secrets of such magnitude from him?</p>
<p class=vb>“Nobody can say how much he knows—maybe he doesn’t even suspect that they exist,” his father soon replied, though with much care to his words and too little defensive a tone. “But if there is one thing what little research we’ve done over the years has revealed… It’s that if an archaeologist’s over their forties, they’re likely to be in on it,” he admitted ruefully. “Whether they’re involved or not, allies or foes, there are surely very few among them who never heard of them at least once in their life.”</p>
<p class=vb>“I think it’s because they were much more overt in the beginning,” his wife continued. “In the last few decades, they have become much more discreet. But when I say ‘more discreet’… I don’t mean at all that they have become any less dangerous.”</p>
<p class=vb>Once again, Clay’s predictions came back to confirm that their fears were indeed justified.</p>
<p class=vb>“In any case,” Roland concluded after a long silence, “your mother is right. This is not the kind of case you can solve, Hershel. We only told you about this so you would know enough to stay safe. We all wish it could be otherwise, of course; but no one can stop them. The best thing you can do is avoid catching their attention at all costs.”</p>
<p class=vb>Oh, he was counting on it, yes. He was not a fool.</p>
<p class=vb>This was the exact reason why he needed to get as much information as possible about his brother, and what had happened to him; starting from the very beginning.</p>
<p class=vb>“Ma, Pa… What can you tell me about the aftermath of our parents’ disappearance? As you can imagine, I have very little memory of that time… But I really want to know what happened—in detail.”</p>
<p class=vs>His only response was an umpteenth silence; but the lack of objection allowed him to understand that, at least, they finally agreed that he was perfectly entitled to know the whole truth.</p>
<p class=vb>Regardless even of the need to save someone’s life, if only because he was facing a gaping hole in his memory, concerning such a crucial period which had shaped his whole life… The desire and the need to fill this chasm made him shudder and shiver, filling him with a number of emotions that he would normally, and even in this very moment, never have allowed himself to feel. The simple fact of admitting that some kind of rage was boiling inside him, revolting against such an injustice, only brought him even more frustration, this time turned against himself.</p>
<p class=vb>His rational mind understood their intent; shuffled clues and memories alike, creating a logical path of rock solid, stern and unmoving deductions; calculated the ins and outs, and came to similar conclusions—judging that it was indeed more prudent to have kept the truth hidden. But even so… The pain of betrayal was far from subsiding.</p>
<p class=vb>“If I recall, it took a few weeks between their disappearance and your adoption,” Lucille began. “We had to wait for the word to reach our ears, for a start.”</p>
<p class=vb>“And after that, we had to wait for the adoption papers to be done, too,” her husband muttered with an annoyed, heavy sigh. “From what we had been told, the police couldn’t trace your birth certificates, and they could not find the originals either—it turned out that neither of you were born in Wiltshire. Given that your father was an archaeologist, it’s not too surprising to imagine that you would have moved several times…”</p>
<p class=vb>Well. What do you know.</p>
<p class=vb>“Could they really not find anything?” he insisted with a doubtful, but discreet and well restrained hesitation.</p>
<p class=vb>“Oh, surely they could have got hold of at least your birth certificates if they had searched the records in other counties, but they weren’t going to turn the whole of England upside down just for this.”</p>
<p class=vb>She had said this as if with a touch of humour; but she had not put any positive emotion into it. Like him, she understood why such a thing had not been done… but was hurt nonetheless that it had not been.</p>
<p class=vb>The son was far too busy to notice the similarity, however; his mind was already following a much different train of thought.</p>
<p class=vb>“The poor child…” she continued sadly. “You had just lost your parents, and social services had no choice but to rely on your brother to fill in the gaps.”</p>
<p class=vb>How convenient.</p>
<p class=vb>“I imagine the kidnappers took everything from your father’s office, and left with your identity papers in the process, whether on purpose or by accident,” Roland grumbled.</p>
<p class=vb>No. He strongly doubted it.</p>
<p class=vs>Even though his memory was fuzzy and fragmented… He was almost certain that these men had not remained for long enough to search the entire house; in fact, it was a safe assumption to make that if they had, he and his brother would have been found and abducted as well, or worse.</p>
<p class=vs>He had a vague recollection of his brother often locking himself in their father’s office, and he always pictured that office filled with loose sheets of paper, books old and new, all scattered in a monstrous mess on every single horizontal surface available—save for, ironically, the one piece of furniture whose function was precisely supposed to be used as a support for intensive studies. All these piles of text and information could not have appeared overnight, and very little of it was not already looking familiar to his younger self.</p>
<p class=vb>He was also certain, this time completely, that these men had never returned; which meant that they had not had the opportunity to retrieve anything else before he was adopted.</p>
<p class=vs>Thinking again of his brother… He thus kept to himself a different hypothesis.</p>
<p class=vb>But what could he have possibly been up to, especially at such a young age?</p>
<p class=vb>He took a long, deep inhale. He closed his eyes tightly and shook his head, trying once again to chase away those distant images of a stolen childhood and bury them in the world of his subconscious, where they had surfaced from; in vain. He exhaled for a long time, his breath struggling to evade his lungs and slip out of his trembling lips.</p>
<p class=vb>“It seems to me…” He hesitated again. In many ways, it was far too challenging for him to even align such words in a single sentence. “It was a long time ago, of course. But I have this vague recollection that… you had specifically chosen to adopt ‘Hershel’ in particular. May I ask why?”</p>
<p class=vs>He was not surprised to be met once again with a heavy silence. His question—an accusation, even—was far from trivial, after all.</p>
<p class=vb>While he waited for his answer, he did not know whether he dared hope that this memory was biassed, and his fears unfounded; or whether he had resigned himself to following his implacable deductions to the end.</p>
<p class=vb>“They were all talking about ‘little Hershel’ taking over his father’s research,” sighed Lucille. “It was only a matter of days before the rumours would go out of hand.”</p>
<p class=vb>“They said you’d started to delve into his work, trying to understand why your parents were taken,” Roland explained. “We wanted to make sure you stayed out of this madness. These men are unscrupulous and wouldn’t hesitate to go after a child, even a child who’d barely be able to understand anything on his own.”</p>
<p class=vb>The tremors in his hands became even more difficult to control.</p>
<p class=vb>He really, <i>really</i> dreaded where this conversation was going. He hoped he was once again jumping to conclusions based on incomplete and biassed fragments of evidence, but… But if he was right, then all the pieces of the puzzle were coming together perfectly, and ready to depict a family portrait tainted with blood and tragedy.</p>
<p class=vb>“Of course, when we saw that you were only three years old, we realised that these were just unfounded rumours,” his father added with a huff of relief, almost laughing. “If it had been your brother, it could’ve been slightly more plausible… but even then, it would have already been quite hard to believe.”</p>
<p class=vb>“That did not stop them from trying to find him anyway! Those crazy madmen… They hear the slightest rumour, and they’re already jumping in to harass innocents without even checking their sources. I can’t believe they followed us to Stansbury! We had moved there <i>specifically</i> because they’d lost interest in the wall of Norwell decades earlier.”</p>
<p class=vb>His head was spinning. This puzzle, now solved, illustrated a picture of the past, of the present, and even of the future, which seemed so perfect, so simple… so terrifying.</p>
<p class=vb>“Perhaps it would’ve been wiser to entrust Hershel to the Sycamores,” he heard whispered in the distance. He assumed that his father thought that these words would escape his ears; given what they implied, he could see why. “We’d only had him for a week, it wasn’t too late to reunite them once more.”</p>
<p class=vb>“But even though it would’ve been fairer to never separate them in the first place… Desmond always refused to let us talk about him,” Lucille whispered back with an apologetic tone.</p>
<p class=vs>No.</p>
<p class=vb>No, they did not just…</p>
<p class=vb>His blood ran cold, and he felt it drain out of his face completely.</p>
<p class=vb>“You… You <i>kept in touch</i> with him all this time. And you <i>never</i> told me?”</p>
<p class=vb>Even if one or the other had answered, his ears were ringing so loudly that he would not have paid attention to it. Whether there were a justification or not, whether that justification were that <i>he had to be protected from all this madness</i> or not, he did not care anymore. He was twenty-seven years old, and he was perfectly capable and <i>entitled</i> to make his own decisions, <i>thank you very much</i>.</p>
<p class=vb>The handle of his receiver cracked once more.</p>
<p class=vb>“Ma, Pa, I have one last question. Who’s Theodore Bronev?”</p>
<p class=vs>He tried to ignore the fact that a strange nervous grin had begun to creep its way onto his face.</p>
<p class=vb>He heard some confused noises from the other side of the line, and quickly deduced that they had no clue. Thankfully so; he did not know whether he would have been able to look them in the eye ever again if they had.</p>
<p class=vb>“I will give you a hint,” he said in a voice he struggled to keep steady. “My parents had two sons: Hershel, and Theodore.”</p>
<p class=vb>“Do you mean Desmond, then? It’s true that he was very attached to erasing as many traces of your origins as possible, but… So he went as far as to change his first name as well after he was adopted? He never told us about this. I wonder what could have motivated him to make such a choice…”</p>
<p class=vb>The son did not know either, but even without having seen or heard of him in over twenty years, he believed he had a fairly good guess.</p>
<p class=vb><i>That’s your name now, Hershel.</i></p>
<p class=vb>“Incorrect. Theodore Bronev… was me.”</p>
<p class=vb>He would have preferred to continue right away, but to his regret, he was already in need to catch his breath. Oh well; this granted his parents the benefit of breathing for a few seconds too, provided they were able to do so in this moment.</p>
<p class=vb>“The real Hershel Bronev… planned for you to adopt me in his stead. And he succeeded.”</p>
<p class=vb>And he fell silent.</p>
<p class=vb>Quite honestly, part of him was tempted to bid them a <i>good day</i>, hang up on them, and let them brood over those last words and their implications. Fortunately for them, unfortunately for him, he managed to convince himself that Claire would certainly have been disappointed by such behaviour.</p>
<p class=vb>Through the receiver, he heard in the distance his mother’s terrified sobs, and his father’s nervous, muffled mutterings, as he grumbled something about having been outwitted by a seven-year-old.</p>
<p class=vb>The son was not certain how to conclude, in all honesty; and the last part of him that still tried to keep his composure feared that, were he to deign open his mouth again in such a moment, nothing good nor polite would come out of it.</p>
<p class=vb>It took several more long seconds, but finally Roland decided to speak to him again.</p>
<p class=vb>“…Perhaps it would be wiser to keep the rest of this conversation for later, son. This deserves more than just a phone call. We should talk about it face to face.”</p>
<p class=vb>He was grateful that his father shared his need to get this over with.</p>
<p class=vb>“Yes… I agree, Pa. We should all discuss this together.”</p>
<p class=vb>He let the silence settle. It took a few more seconds for his words to have their desired effect.</p>
<p class=vb>“…‘All’?” Lucille soon parroted in a small, frail voice. “‘Together’…?”</p>
<p class=vb>“Isn’t it obvious?” he replied at once. “It appears to me that this matter involves my brother just as much as us three,” he declared with authority and determination.</p>
<p class=vb>He could not tell what he hated more, between the harshness of his words or his voice cracking under the yoke of emotion.</p>
<p class=vb>“You have kept in touch with him for years,” he added with thinly veiled bitterness. “It isn’t as if I were asking you to invite a stranger.”</p>
<p class=vb>Under other circumstances, he would have waited at least until one of them would respond to his invitation. In this very moment, the fact that he had to wait for more than five seconds became too much to bear, and he dropped the receiver on its stand. His hand still trembling, he needed a moment of nearly absolute immobility, simply to wrap his mind around what had just occurred.</p>
<p class=vb>Eventually… He took a deep breath; clenched his fists; slowly relaxed them; and pushed open the door to the living room, heading straight for the golden goose that had been freshly released from the poultry house of the absurd.</p>
<p class=vb>Desmond Sycamore. At last, he had his name.</p>
<p class=vs>Preservation of History and balance of the time-space continuum or not, it was out of the question to let some dubious criminal organisation cause harm to his brother. No matter their means and determination, they would not lay a single hand on him or his new relatives.</p>
<p class=vb>He would never let this happen. Not before he, himself, would have been at least granted the time to visit him personally, share a nice cup of tea on a charming, rainy afternoon, calmly demand the explanations he utterly deserved, and give him a piece of his mind with <i>frankness</i>, <i>honesty</i>, and <i>transparency</i>, like a true gentleman would.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vb>He did not immediately make his presence known. When he returned to his living room, his two guests were in the midst of a conversation centred on what, under other circumstances, he would have relegated to the level of mere ludicrous and fictitious adventures.</p>
<p class=vb>“There’s also that time when he had to solve an inheritance dispute in St. Mystere…”</p>
<p class=vb>“Oh, finally! This one seems mundane enough,” the woman breathed with relief. “You got me good for a little while, I almost thought you would only put us through death-endangering adventures with unbelievable twists.”</p>
<p class=vb>“Yeah, but then there was this whole thing with the serial murders and the old man kidnapping the villagers, and in the end it turned out that everything was fake because everyone was a robot. Also, the professor almost got crushed by a remote-controlled Ferris wheel, and he and Flora probably wouldn’t have survived if he hadn’t managed to build a hang-glider out of the curtains in her room.”</p>
<p class=vb>“…Why couldn’t I just keep my mouth shut,” Claire sighed, brushing a tired hand between her eyes and her glasses.</p>
<p class=vb>He felt that this was the most opportune moment for him to let them know that he had returned. He lightly creaked the wooden floor as he took a few steps forward, and obtained the physicist’s attention when he closed the front door behind him.</p>
<p class=vb>“Oh, Hershel!” she exclaimed with a strange mixture of surprise, comfort, and concern. “How do you feel? What happened?”</p>
<p class=vs>He opened his mouth, but nothing came out. He lowered his eyes so as not to have to look at her; directed them at the little shape-shifter who, unlike her, had not moved from their seat; closed them, heaving a strained sigh.</p>
<p class=vb>When his eyelids opened once more, nothing came out of his ebony pupils other than a raw and limitless determination.</p>
<p class=vb>“Clay,” he called out with authority. “Do you have, per chance, any other world-shattering revelations about my personal life that I should be made aware of?”</p>
<p class=vb>The young lady took a quick but delicate step away from him, taken aback; she exchanged a silent glance with the child; they did not notice it, and therefore did not respond to it either.</p>
<p class=vb>“Uh… Claire said it might be best to wait a bit until you’ve had some time to recollect yourself, before I…”</p>
<p class=vs>The child briefly turned their eyes away from him, and met at last those of the woman they had just named; and they realised that hers had grown as big as saucers, and were now glowing with this specific, poignant pain which could only find its roots within the most primitive wounds of betrayal.</p>
<p class=vb>They blinked in confusion, then opened their lips slightly in a small, shy circle, miming a silent <i>“Oh…”</i>; a sign of their slightly too late grasp over the consequences that these exact words would have. Was this what she had meant when she said that he did not need to hear that either?</p>
<p class=vb>In his defence, the man at least had the decency not to attempt to reply with the blatant lie that he was thinking with such intensity in his mind, that he had no need to use his voice in order to share his feelings and opinion on the matter. His cold body trembling with anguish and rage, his face tense and his lips dry, his eyes far too insistent like two swords of Damocles falling on his target, managed to tell all by themselves that <i>he was perfectly calm</i>.</p>
<p class=vb>Claire tried to speak up and calm him down, but he did not seem to hear her. Slowly, but without the slightest hesitation, he walked towards the origin of all the events that had gradually eaten away at his afternoon and sanity.</p>
<p class=vb>“<i>Clay</i>.”</p>
<p class=vb>The time traveller was intimidated up to the point that they momentarily found their cold shivers peek out of their back and start dancing like little waves of ferrofluid spikes pulled by the field of an invisible magnet.</p>
<p class=vb>“Is there something <i>else</i> I need to know?”</p>
<p class=vb>Succumbing to the pressure, the jumper of what hardly looked like Luke Triton anymore split into a light open jacket and turned purple. They buried their head in their shoulders and their arms clutched the black pouch once more, their eyes darting away from him at the speed of thunder. Reluctantly, they shyly blurted out two words and a half:</p>
<p class=vb>“Randall’s alive.”</p>
