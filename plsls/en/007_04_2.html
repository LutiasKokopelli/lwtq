<h2>August 22, 1953<br>04:41 PM<div class=hr></div></h2>
<p class=vb>It was the second time this day that Dimitri found himself running through the streets of Bloomsbury at top speed. The first time had been when he thought the life of Claire and the neighbourhood in danger; the second time was in this moment, when they had reasons to believe that, in the worst possible case scenario, the very fabric of space-time was at stake.</p>
<p class=vb>It was, without a doubt, the worst day off of his entire life, past and future. Luckily his flat was closeby, and fortunately Claire’s words were still fresh in his mind to give him courage and strength on the way… And besides, after all, <i>healthy mind in a healthy body</i>, he told himself, trying as best he could to silence the sarcastic tone that accompanied this remark.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vs>Dimitri had returned home just twenty minutes or so earlier, crashed into his couch, and planned no particular goal for the rest of the afternoon, other than to keep lying in it until at least suppertime. His fatigue was more psychological than physical; which was quite a feat by itself, considering the fact that the cleaning and the marathon he had had to run just over two hours before weighed heavily on the latter part. Nonetheless, he had gladly yielded to the call of a good nap.</p>
<p class=vb>However, this was without accounting for his telephone, which had soon enough decided to wake him from a sleep he had barely even had time to reach. The love of his life, admittedly not reciprocated but despite everything so irresistible, had had something new to share regarding her investigation… And she did not have good news.</p>
<p class=vs>He had not been granted with much detail, and had only been able to piece together the clues that the entity was now called ‘Clay’, that they allegedly came from a future that was no more, and consequently, that their time travel had <i>presumably</i> not been harmless to the course of time as they had originally known it.</p>
<p class=vb>He had been sceptical at first, reminding his colleague and friend that time paradoxes of this type only belonged to the realm of fiction, and were not supposed to be physically feasible; nonetheless, he had granted her without much hesitation the chance to justify her opinion. Claire was bright enough to know just as well as he did that, according to everything they knew up until this point, what she was describing should be impossible: therefore, she must have had an extremely good reason to change her mind.</p>
<p class=vb>First of all, she had recalled for the umpteenth time that the incongruous way they had appeared had been both seemingly fortuitous, and yet devilishly precise. If this truly had been a deliberate, carefully planned time travel which had been meant to lead to a classic, innocuous time loop, then it would have been far more logical and prudent to send Clay <i>before</i> the experiment, and give them the mission to <i>convince</i> Bill and her to cancel it. Instead, Clay had arrived <i>during</i> the experiment, and <i>forced</i> them to cancel it—to top it off, by causing a small explosion that rendered their prototype unusable, and which would most definitely have been lethal to any normal human being standing in their place.</p>
<p class=vb>It had also led them to assume that Clay’s new constitution had been precisely the only reason why they had survived such a sensational appearance. Still, their partial amnesia, as well as their naïve and sometimes incoherent behaviour… Were these signs that they had not come out of this event unscathed? If their transformations had not affected them to an extent big enough that their entire metabolism would have become completely unrecognisable, then it was more than likely that they had ended up with a concussion at best, with more internal and major damage than he had dared imagine at worst.</p>
<p class=vs>This observation was so obvious in hindsight, that Dimitri had wondered how they had not thought of it sooner. He had immediately considered demanding that Claire take them to the nearest hospital, so that they could make sure that their health was not in danger… But he had reconsidered just as quickly.</p>
<p class=vb>Even assuming that they would have successfully made it to the hospital without accidentally scaring any bystanders, which was already no small feat by itself, then it would have been impossible to examine them without the doctors discovering their secret. Worse: was it even possible to examine them at all and establish a reliable diagnosis, in view of their eternally changing body? For all he knew, each transformation altered their metabolism in its entirety, and simply scanning their skull for signs of internal bleeding would have been impossible anyway. And he had not even dared to think of what might have been attempted, if they had to face the necessity of surgery on a body that had the stability of playdough…</p>
<p class=vs>Not that Dimitri distrusted doctors, far from it; but he sincerely doubted that they could help in this specific case. And quite on the contrary, he feared the consequences which could have resulted from the unavoidable uproar, once they would have come across new witnesses of their still uncontrollable metamorphoses. Combining Clay and a hospital room was a scenario which could go sour in so many different ways, that he had not bothered to count them all.</p>
<p class=vb>And thus, as counter-intuitive as it might seem at first glance… He had concluded that taking Clay to a doctor or a hospital would have actually put them in more danger than doing nothing and taking the risk of seeing their condition worsen over time.</p>
<p class=vb>In the end, Claire had promised to take care of it later; but only after the problem they already had on their hands was solved. As far as she knew at the moment, Clay was not in much more danger than anyone else living on this planet, and so their health was, for the time being, hardly the highest priority.</p>
<p class=vb><i>“Still, what makes you think that it <b>has</b> to be a grandfather paradox?”</i> he had insisted then, still surprised that she was so convinced.</p>
<p class=vb><i>“This is just one example out of a whole list they gave us, but Clay mentioned that the building in front of the lab would have been destroyed, that a boy would have lost his parents then, and that this would have driven him to a path of crime.”</i></p>
<p class=vb>Dimitri had been quite taken aback by such an astonishing response. The mention of such people, which were completely unrelated to the experiment, had been entirely unexpected in their conversation.</p>
<p class=vb><i>“What does an orphan have to do with any of this? And how could Clay know of such an innocuous and unpredictable detail…?”</i></p>
<p class=vb><i>“It’s far too precise for a classic time loop,”</i> she had immediately agreed to his remark. <i>“Clay had to have lived in this alternate timeline, for long enough to be a first-hand witness to everything they talked about.”</i></p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vb>There were, all in all, two main types of time paradoxes.</p>
<p class=vs>The grandfather paradox implied that a person returning to, and altering their past, would prevent the conditions that initially let their time travel take place. This first paradox was named as such after the example of a man who, for some unfathomable reason, would have travelled to a time when his grandfather was only a young child, and would have murdered him, preventing his own birth thereafter, and therefore preventing his own time travel.</p>
<p class=vs>The writer paradox implied that a person returning to, but <i>not</i> altering their past, would have actually put in motion the conditions that initially let their time travel take place—conditions that could not have occurred without their action on the course of time. This second paradox was thus named after the example of a writer who would have sent his magnum opus into the past, and whose younger alter-ego would have copied word for word what he had been sent, before publishing it and becoming a great author, instead of having actually written it from scratch.</p>
<p class=vb>Both challenged logic and causality, but in opposite ways. One obliterated the integrity of History, through an event which prevented itself from taking place; the other consolidated it, although in an unconventional way, through an event which made itself take place.</p>
<p class=vs>Their theoretical model had so far suggested that the former was unfeasible: the contradiction on the course of time that it generated was insoluble, or almost, and it was impossible to predict what consequences such a singularity could have on the integrity of space-time. The easiest solution, therefore, had been to conclude that it was outright impossible to create such a situation, no matter the circumstances.</p>
<p class=vb>The latter, on the other hand, was considered harmless and perfectly possible; and even more than that, it had been one of the motivations behind their project—the one that had let them receive the funding to carry it out. The only two counterintuitive aspects that resulted from this situation were, on the one hand, the fact that History could very well have followed its course with or without this loop of causality; and on the other hand, the fact that information was created out of nowhere, or at least presumably so.</p>
<p class=vb>The information that Clay had provided needed to have a known and grounded origin. If, for example, it was a question of going back in time in order to warn the world that a building was going to collapse, then the only way to obtain proof of this was to inspect it and verify that everything was in check. Either the inspection had already been made but dismissed, and the messenger had come to bring to light its relevance; or it had not, in which case the messenger had come to demand that it be made, in order to obtain proof that the risk was present, and thus justify their future time travel.</p>
<p class=vb>However, one piece of information that the messenger could not deliver at any time would be a vivid description of the accident taking place. They could safely relay the information that, if nothing was done, then the building would <i>probably</i> collapse; it was possible for them to show graphs and simulations that would make it possible to <i>hypothesise</i> what <i>could</i> have occurred if they did not act; but it was impossible for them to have seen the catastrophe in itself unfold before their very eyes. It was impossible for them to know when or how this was going to happen: they could not guess which wall would have fallen first, or what the extent of the damage would have been. It was impossible for them to predict the number of victims involved, since the accident had not, and <i>would never have</i> taken place.</p>
<p class=vs>From what he had been told, Clay’s knowledge was far too precise. The details were so numerous, so specific, and recounted the consequences that would have taken place so long after the experiment they had prevented… This could no longer be a hypothetical future, but really an alternate timeline which was, or had been at some point, just as real as their own.</p>
<p class=vb>Claire had insisted so much, and this point in particular was so intriguing and inexplicable, that he had finally been convinced.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vs>Claire had not taken the time, and perhaps not thought necessary to give him the full list of events which had been changed accordingly; but he had needed the help of nobody to deduce the most obvious. He had felt his heart skip a beat when he understood; but Claire had not granted him more than just a few seconds to think about it, because she had already changed the subject.</p>
<p class=vb>Either she herself had, by some miracle, still not realised; or she had already managed to get over it and move on… He did not know whether he should find her brave, crazy, or even almost selfish, for her to dwell so little on the fact that she <i>had</i> died under other circumstances—that it was no longer a matter of guesswork, but of an event that had, at some point, been real, even though it no longer was in their new present.</p>
<p class=vb>There will always be those who say that mourning is harder for the loved ones than for the deceased themselves, of course. But still…</p>
<p class=vs>After listening to her for a bit longer, he had been able to deduce fairly quickly that at least one of the reasons why she barely thought about it was the same one that had led her to temporarily dismiss the issue of Clay’s health: she was far more concerned about the well-being of the entire universe. Saving her life, of course, she appreciated the gesture; but at such a price? If the whole universe were to see its laws rewritten and suddenly become uninhabitable, she saw little purpose in having been able to survive for only a few more hours or days, if it meant dooming the entire world afterwards, herself included.</p>
<p class=vb>No, as always… She lived in the heat of the moment, and kept the weight of her emotions for later. All of this would come back to bite her at some point, perhaps even with double the intensity; but not before the current problem was fixed. This ability to keep a cool head in the face of such a situation… He envied her and admired her, just as much as she intimidated him to the highest point.</p>
<p class=vb>The scenarios she had mentioned were improbable, formulated in panic, and therefore fallible; but they were still based on solid grounds, and so her concern was perfectly justified. “Improbable” did not mean <i>impossible</i>.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vb>And so, he had immediately hung up the phone, put his white coat back on, and slammed his apartment’s front door behind him, hoping once again to reach the laboratory as quickly as physically possible; for each minute that passed without him being able to hear news from Claire became always a little more unbearable than the last.</p>
<p class=vb>Yes, even in this moment, he needed tangible proof that she was still alive, and that the alternate reality in which Clay had not been there to stop the experiment was no more. He admitted it. But in view of all these events, could anyone really blame him?</p>
<p class=vb>The trip had seemed endless, as he was left alone with his thoughts. When finally the doors of the Gressenheller campus were passed, followed by those of the Institute of Polydimensional Research, he allowed himself to catch his breath, before climbing the last steps which separated him from their laboratory. Today more than any other day, why was it that out of the three floors that made their institute, <i>obviously</i>, their office had to be located on the top one…</p>
<p class=vb>The keys struggled to fit into the lock, and the pounding of his heart against his temple sounded almost as if his whole body was mocking his inability to control his breathless tremors; but finally he could get in, finally he could run to all the devices he needed, finally he could pull all the levers and activate all the necessary switches, and finally, <i>finally</i> he could pick up the telephone, dial a number, and crash into a chair, now waiting for her to respond while he kept a distant but as attentive eye as his fatigue would allow him on the various experiments he had set in motion.</p>
<p class=vb>Fortunately, the answer came quickly. Claire even had the kindness to share with him her worry when she heard that he was out of breath, and to apologise for having rushed him so much. She did not fail to point out that she had expected to wait fifteen, or even twenty minutes, before he could arrive, start the machines, and run the tests; but certainly not eight. He merely replied that it was nothing, that it was for a good cause and that he would get over it, as he tried his best to ignore the sickening ferrous taste of haemoglobin that had gained his throat for the second time that day.</p>
<p class=vb>“I tried to make some calculations by accounting for a simpler system, but I fear that I can’t do much with so many approximations,” Claire quickly declared through the receiver. “I wish I could give some predictions, but there are so many variables to consider…”</p>
<p class=vb>“I doubt that anyone could boil down everything that happened today into mere equations,” he sighed back. “Don’t worry, the scans are on their way. We will soon get to the bottom of this.”</p>
<p class=vb>“Regardless, I really can’t find any solid explanation behind Clay’s situation,” she concluded. “It must have something to do with their time travel, but how could such a thing happen…?”</p>
<p class=vb>He had no answer to offer, and he was certain that his tests were unfortunately not going to help them in this regard. Nevertheless, these tests would at least have the great advantage of revealing to them once and for all in which state the very fabric of the universe was, and whether or not it was time for them to bid their last prayers while waiting for the world to end.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vb>Objectively, the first results had not taken long to arrive. Subjectively for the two physicists, twelve minutes was as endless a delay as had been the flow of the ever more alarmist hypotheses that had embellished their conversation, which had been much richer in complex words and vicious circles of panic, than in real constructive thoughts.</p>
<p class=vb>And so, once Dimitri had taken a worried look at the tables and graphs, filled with great attention and apprehension… The verdict came:</p>
<p class=vb>“…Everything is normal.”</p>
<p class=vb>This was… almost disappointing. They had witnessed the first time travel in History, this time travel had <i>presumably</i> resulted in a grandfather paradox or one of its variants, and… Their scanners detected absolutely nothing? Was that really it?</p>
<p class=vb>“Are you sure?” his assistant insisted, flabbergasted and sceptical. “You can’t even detect any local distortion? Clay must have gone through a vortex when they arrived in our time, right? And surely, the fault should have remained open because of the paradox…”</p>
<p class=vb>“This is the first thing I checked,” he retorted in a dumbfounded breath, “but I really don’t see anything. Or, if there’s really been an interference, then it’s too weak to detect… I also find it hard to believe, but it appears that the fault was indeed closed without causing any damage.”</p>
<p class=vs>The good news was that in the end, at least at first glance, no one was in danger. The bad news was that now… They felt even more ignorant and confused about this situation than they had been at first. What was going on?</p>
<p class=vb>As Claire had mentioned, a vortex, then a fault, had inevitably opened so that Clay could have left their time, passed through it, then left and found themselves in their laboratory. But for this fault to have closed so quickly afterwards, without leaving a single trace…</p>
<p class=vs>Dimitri would not have been surprised by such a result, if only the ‘time paradox’ aspect of the situation were not to be taken into account. Their own machine admittedly had a design error that made it unstable in practice; but this error was separate from the theoretical operation of their prototype, and was completely independent from the part responsible for generating the vortex itself.</p>
<p class=vs>This design error would have caused the machine to implode before, during, or just after it performed its task. It was critical enough to cause the deaths of people nearby, once the cables linked to the cooling system would have failed, as they were too fragile to support the flow necessary to keep the generator under control throughout the experiment, and thus that this generator would have overheated and gone out of control in consequence. But it was not critical enough to cause damage to the fabric of space-time itself.</p>
<p class=vb>The results he had before him would not have been surprising if Clay had undergone a standard time travel, using a machine similar to theirs. However, if History had indeed been changed, if a grandfather paradox had indeed taken place, then… what was to be concluded? That, against all odds, the fact that Claire was alive or dead, the fact that their machine had exploded or not, the fact that Clay had changed or not the course of time… That the impact of all these divergences, of all these contradictions, was all in all so weak?</p>
<p class=vs>It was… a very strange feeling, to feel so small and insignificant within the infinity of the cosmos. Dimitri was reading on these graphs that his whole life could have been destroyed or rebuilt on this day, his own just as much as those of so many others around him; and yet, that despite all this… Physics itself, which had fascinated him so much and made him dream for years, was now making him realise that on its scale…</p>
<p class=vb>Ha. How arrogant of them to think that their actions could one day have such an impact on the world; when in reality, the life or the death of one person, the joys and despairs of others, left no trace on the cold and implacable immensity of the universe.</p>
<p class=vb>No one was in danger; but now that this fear had subsided, they had raised a new question that seemed innocuous, and yet all at the same time so terrible:</p>
<p class=vb><i>What now?</i></p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vb>“If that’s really all… I have to talk to Clay again,” the young woman continued after a long silence. “I’m really sorry for troubling you.”</p>
<p class=vb>“Not at all, you did the right thing,” he reassured. “At least, now we know for sure.” The fact that she mentioned the time traveller aroused his curiosity, however; so he dared to ask: “What will you be talking about?”</p>
<p class=vb>“Their plans,” she sighed with a hint of exasperation. “Despite their amnesia, Clay seems to remember other future disasters that we could prevent. If the scanners claim that altering the course of time more than it already has will have no visible consequences, then… I suppose it is at least worth hearing them out.”</p>
<p class=vs>Indeed, judging by what he had before his eyes, everything led to believe that the way was clear for all sorts of peregrinations of this kind; so he raised no objection, and on the contrary, expressed his joy at the idea of having on the one hand a little guardian angel capable of saving even more lives, and on the other a charming couple of two brains capable of ensuring that their time-travelling knowledge would be used wisely.</p>
<p class=vb>With a long sigh of relief, Dimitri bid his colleague goodbye and wished her a successful investigation. Pulling the receiver away from his ear, he plunged his free hand into one of his white coat’s pockets… and felt the presence of a certain small, flat, metallic square, whose existence he had until then completely forgotten. His eyes widened at this sudden reminder, and he immediately tried to inform her:</p>
<p class=vb>“Oh, Claire, wait—!”</p>
<p class=vb>But she had already hung up. Never mind.</p>
<p class=vs>Leaning back in his chair and raising his feet to lay them nonchalantly on the empty desk in front of him, Dimitri grabbed the little emerald green card between his fingers, took it out of his pocket, and juggled it in front of his eyes with a newfound curiosity. He still had no idea how to retrieve its contents; but he now had some idea regarding its exact nature, as well as the real purpose behind its presence in this place, at this moment.</p>
<p class=vb>So, their new friend had more memories of this fabled unfeasible future, and on top of this, Claire mentioned that they had devised ‘plans’ in order to alert them of more upcoming accidents, and prevent them from taking place?</p>
<p class=vb>This changed everything. Absolutely everything.</p>
<p class=vs>It all was clear in his mind, now. Someone had deliberately travelled back to their past: either in order to generate a time loop such as the ones they originally intended to create with their own project; or with the intent of outright modifying History, as Claire had deduced, and as he had thought blindly until this precise moment.</p>
<p class=vs>In view of the clues they currently had at their disposal, it was impossible for them to rule out one hypothesis or the other. The writer paradox was the only one that their theoretical model could explain… but the grandfather paradox was the only one that had the slightest chance of leaving some room for an explanation behind the dire state Clay had found themselves in, as well as explain how they could know so much about a future that would otherwise never have existed.</p>
<p class=vb>In both cases, regardless of the option he considered, the ‘deliberate’ aspect of this act now seemed most obvious to him. This strange little green square, whose title evoked some future that had become unattainable… Its contents, just like its role, had become crystal clear.</p>
<p class=vs>In the past, in all ages and all civilisations, humanity had left various elements for future generations: writings, artefacts, monuments… Just as many time capsules of all kinds, which had no purpose other than to be discovered centuries, or even millennia later, and to reveal their secrets to anyone who would be lucky enough to find them in good condition, and have the necessary intellect to understand their true meaning.</p>
<p class=vb>Well, in a way, this little electronic card could only be some sort of time capsule, but in reverse: this had to be some sort of futuristic artefact filled with information about its time of origin, which had been sent to the past in order to be decrypted. The hastily handwritten inscription present on the green sticky note that had been taped on one side of this mysterious little square was at first glance quite cryptic; but the context behind Clay’s appearance now rendered its meaning crystal clear. After all, what was a future made partially fictitious, and meant to remain as such, if not a reweaved fate?</p>
<p class=vb>And finally, the last clue: since something must have gone wrong during the time travel, which seemed to have caused the amnesia as well as the strange condition of the traveller involved… It was likely that if they had been sent from a future which was going to be rewritten, along with a source of information such as what he had between his fingers, then whoever had sent them here knew full well what they were doing. If their goal had been to alter the past and knowingly create a time paradox, then surely they had planned everything, or almost.</p>
<p class=vb>Clay was a messenger, and this little card was a guarantee that the message would be delivered; it was a back-up solution in case something were to happen to their emissary, and they proved unable to play their role.</p>
<p class=vb>It was all a fine web of deductions that intertwined perfectly, creating a logical and crystal clear scenario… But it challenged one of the assumptions they had made earlier.</p>
<p class=vs>Indeed, if their now unfeasible original future had wanted to send a time traveller to their own past with a specific purpose in mind, and had also sent with them what was most certainly meant to be a wealth of information regarding future disasters and a precise plan to follow… Why send a <i>child</i>?</p>
<p class=vb>The answer now seemed obvious to him: they had made a crucial mistake when estimating their new friend’s age. This childishness, this innocence, this naïvety… Perhaps they were ultimately caused not by their age, but rather by their partial amnesia, and probably even more by the major damage that had probably been inflicted to them at the same time. Again, he hoped that Claire would somehow find a way to ensure that Clay’s well-being was not in danger.</p>
<p class=vs>Again, however, this still did not solve the main mystery. Grandfather paradox, writer paradox… Without knowing the exact nature of the time from which they came, how could they know which of the two they were dealing with? Dimitri had conjectures, but saw few concrete ways to find indisputable proof, and thus to dispel his doubts once and for all.</p>
<p class=vs>The writer paradox had the advantage of conforming to both their theoretical model, and to the graphs he had in front of him; but it could explain neither Clay’s condition, nor their vivid memories of a future that should never have existed. According to Claire, they were definitely not a messenger who had come to relate concise and speculative instructions; they were an actual witness, who had to have been physically present during events that could no longer take place.</p>
<p class=vb>The grandfather paradox had the disadvantage of contradicting what decades of research had established, simply through the single fact that it could, ultimately, exist. But on the other hand, if something as fundamental as the fact that it could be achieved outside of fiction turned out to be true, then it called into question more than half of what they knew about the inner workings of time travel: and this thus opened the doors to an entirely new and unexplored realm, filled with possibilities. This would not promise immediate and perfect answers to the many questions that strewed this mystery… But contrary to its counterpart, this paradox raised at least the possibility that it could solve everything.</p>
<p class=vs>What to choose? A ready-made hypothesis which was consistent with what they knew, solved half of the problems perfectly, but was unable to explain the other half? Or a hypothesis that did not explain anything for the moment, but had a <i>chance</i> to solve the entire case if time and effort were spent on investigating it, just as much as it had a chance of not explaining anything at all? A fifty-fifty, opposed to an all-or-nothing…</p>
<p class=vb>Claire was certain that it was a grandfather paradox, and so he was going to trust her judgement again. The ‘all-or-nothing’ path… Now that he knew that the fabric of space-time was safe, it presented itself as rather intriguing; exciting, even.</p>
<p class=vb>If Clay’s transformations were related to some sort of molecular instability, as Claire had suggested… then it would be reasonable to believe that this small metallic square, which had travelled alongside them, would also show symptoms of it. Of course, he would not be able to test the effects of such a phenomenon on a living organism without examining Clay in person; but this small object already gave him something to do, and was undoubtedly going to give him some preliminary answers. Any result, success or failure, was one step closer to the truth, after all.</p>
<p class=vb>Earlier, the question <i>“What now?”</i> had intimidated him, almost paralysed him. But now, come to think of it… Maybe he had the answer to this question right in front of him.</p>
<p class=vb>Claire already had her own mystery to solve, and he had intended from the start to assist her. Well, while she was busy with her investigation… Maybe unlocking the secrets of this little time capsule would be a good way to start his.</p>
