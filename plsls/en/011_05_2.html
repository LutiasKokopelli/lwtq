<p class=vs>He let the cold water run down his face.</p>
<p class=vs>His wet hands washed the salt away from his eyes, and the anguish away from his tired, but finally relaxing throat.</p>
<p class=vb>His bathroom was small and claustrophobic; yet the familiarity of this enclosed, private space, managed to bring him all the more solace. The sound of the tap water flowing softly before him was music to his ears.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vs>Hershel was reminded of the moment Clay had first intruded on his life.</p>
<p class=vs>Claire, playful as ever, had pretended but for a single minute that this doppelgänger was a twin sister she would have never told him about until then.</p>
<p class=vb>Ironically… In the end, <i>he</i> had been the one ending up with a sibling that no one had ever heard of. How the tables turned.</p>
<p class=vb>Hershel thought of such an absurd and unlikely series of events, and decided to laugh.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vs>Hershel was reminded of the fact that Claire could have died.</p>
<p class=vb><i>Could have.</i> Those were the key words he needed to cling to. Those were the key words he needed to ensure would never, ever leave the realm of the conditional tense.</p>
<p class=vb>Hershel forcefully brushed aside the mental images of something that had not been—of something that would never be—and made the promise that he would never let such thing take place.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vs>Hershel was reminded of his parents’ lies.</p>
<p class=vs>Those had been lies by omission, unless he were to consider his father’s constant dismissing of his mother’s worries; those had been lies, period.</p>
<p class=vb>His birth parents were still, perhaps, present somewhere—he would have to ask Clay whether they had any clue regarding their whereabouts. But even if he were to find them… He would have to see how they were, how they would look at him now; but in the depths of his heart, he knew that Roland and Lucille would always be the parents he would first turn to.</p>
<p class=vb>Hershel succeeded in convincing himself that, despite everything, their lies had been uttered out of love. This still hurt… but just a bit less.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vs>Hershel was reminded of Randall, and the fact that he had dedicated the past ten years to a whole career revolving around his memory—quite the futile and embarrassing act, now that it turned out he had been alive all along.</p>
<p class=vs>How could he even face his former best friend now? Those questions he had kept to himself for all these years, whether he was honouring his memory in the correct way or not… Those had now become more than just an internal conflict.</p>
<p class=vs>Still… He decided that this should not matter. He would not steal Randall’s discoveries. He would not delve into the Azran—or at the very least (since both Clay and his parents had made it clear that they were going to be quite relevant to saving many, many innocent lives anyway), not for the sake of research.</p>
<p class=vb>Besides, Angela and Henry had made their opinion quite clear. They did not need him.</p>
<p class=vb>Hershel decided that, since he now knew the truth, he would bring them closure. With… or, more likely, without him in the picture.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vb>Hershel heard Claire’s words of comfort again, and managed to tell himself that perhaps… perhaps, in the grand scheme of things, all of this had been for the best.</p>
<p class=vs>Had he not been adopted, he would never have met these two wonderful people that were Roland and Lucille—one of the most inseparable and loving couples he had ever seen.</p>
<p class=vs>Had he not had the chance to move to Stansbury, he would never have had his normal high school life with his friends—not only Randall, but also Angela, Henry, and even Dalston. Sure, he no longer knew whether he should still refer to them as friends or not… but for a time, they truly had been; and he was thankful at the very least for the good times. Had these good times not been so important to him in the first place, the tragedy would never have hurt as much as it did.</p>
<p class=vs>Had he not left Stansbury, and had he not chosen archaeology over any other subject he could have found interest in, he would never have had the chance to meet the people he now felt the closest to—Clark, Brenda, Andrew, and most importantly…</p>
<p class=vb>Had he not ended up in Gressenheller… He would never have met Claire.</p>
<p class=vs>Claire had said that while he had been forced to cut ties with many people from his past, his birth parents, his brother, the friends he had in high school… Those were all ties that could be mended.</p>
<p class=vb>It would not be easy, and he could hardly even call it feasible… but it still was infinitely easier than to mend ties that had never been weaved in the first place.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vs>Hershel raised his red, still somewhat stinging eyes, and looked ahead to face his reflection in the mirror. He saw the image of a broken man… but a broken man who, unbelievably enough, could have suffered so much worse still.</p>
<p class=vs>A broken man who had vowed to never let tragedy befall his life and those of his loved ones ever again.</p>
<p class=vb>A man who was now ready to fight against the entire world, if this were what it would take in order to bring everyone peace.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vs>When Hershel walked out of his bathroom and looked back to his bed, he saw Claire waiting for him with patience and kindness. She heard him open and close the door, and she looked up; he took a deep but unconstrained breath and nodded slightly, then went to sit by her side. She went for his hand, and he gently seized hers in silence, interlacing his fingers between hers. Looking back up, the smile he gave her was small, but the relief was genuine; and so, she gladly returned it with a face radiating with love and calm, supportive joy.</p>
<p class=vb>Clenching his hand tightly around hers, holding on to it as desperately as he needed all the while trying not to make his grip too tense and thus unwelcome… he pinched his lips nervously.</p>
<p class=vb>“Claire…” he started hesitantly, but only because he did not want his strong resolve to sound too imposing. “I don’t know which disasters Clay told you about, but I believe there is one that they might have deliberately neglected to mention to you. One that would be a lot more imminent than any other they told me about, that is.”</p>
<p class=vs>At first, the woman raised her eyebrows in surprise; but she soon made the correct deduction that, as she had said herself and as she and the child had both agreed, such a disaster would have been kept silent specifically because it would hit too little too close to Hershel’s personal life; and as such, because they had all decided that only Hershel himself would mention them, only if he chose to, only at the date and time he wished to.</p>
<p class=vb>As it seemed, this was such a moment; and judging by his tone and choice of words, there was at least some urgency to this specific event.</p>
<p class=vb>“While I was talking to my parents,” he continued, “I heard that… They referred to my brother as ‘Desmond Sycamore.’ Did Clay tell you anything about someone with that name?”</p>
<p class=vb>“That rings a bell,” she admitted. “So I do think they did, but they never said anything about him being your brother.”</p>
<p class=vs>Hershel nodded and hummed in acknowledgement, visibly satisfied and relieved to see that, for once, the best turn of events he could have hoped for had taken place.</p>
<p class=vb>Claire’s eyes squinted away from him and slightly to the side, as she focused on her thoughts for a few seconds and tried to retrace the exact memory she was looking for.</p>
<p class=vb>“One of the cases they told me about involved you working alongside him, I believe. He would have been a famous archaeologist by this point, and he would have asked for your assistance with some mystery regarding a… living mummy?” She sighed heavily, exasperation in her voice when she continued: “Even if their stories are completely true, they’re still far too difficult to believe… and with their thought process being all over the place, they certainly do not make it any easier when it comes to piecing together the exact chronology and details of what they’re talking about.”</p>
<p class=vb>As he had suspected, his brother was an archaeologist. This did solidify all at the same time the confidence he had in Clay’s predictions and his subsequent deductions, and his fears at the risk of seeing this accursed tragedy unfold for a second time in the near future.</p>
<p class=vb>“I need… The reason Clay told me about him was not just for the sake of my upbringing,” he confessed heavily. “He needs help. If we don’t do anything… According to Clay, innocent lives will be in danger.”</p>
<p class=vb>Claire’s lips opened slightly, as she took a silent breath; but she did not speak immediately.</p>
<p class=vb>“When?” She did not feel the need to clarify. One word was enough.</p>
<p class=vb>“We don’t know. But there is… There is no time to waste. They said that, in the worst case scenario, it already took place,” he said sombrely. “They were still hopeful and insistant about it, though. So if there is even the slightest chance that I can still save them…”</p>
<p class=vb>“…then <i><b>we</b></i> shall make sure that such a tragedy never occurs,” she resolutely cut in. “I am not letting you do this alone, Hershel.” The man frowned in what appeared to be surprise or confusion, but she interrupted him before he could do so much as open his mouth: “What do you take me for? No matter what happens, I will be with you every step of the way. You won’t get rid of me that easily,” she concluded in a light, almost joking tone.</p>
<p class=vs>She saw his mouth distort in some strange mixture between an ironic chuckle and a depressed sob. Looking down, she bit her lip and tightened her grip on his hand.</p>
<p class=vb><i>Right</i>. She really just kept… conveniently forgetting about that part.</p>
<p class=vb>“…Well,” she quickly corrected, “not <i>this</i> time, that is.”</p>
<p class=vb>His hand quivered in desperate determination.</p>
<p class=vb>“I must make sure of it,” she saw his lips whisper inaudibly.</p>
<p class=vb>“No,” she retorted in a sharp voice. “<i><b>I</b></i> will make sure of it. You already have your own burdens, and they are the heaviest burdens I’ve ever heard of. From now on, no more taking responsibility for others, Hershel. I won’t let you.”</p>
<p class=vb>He met her eyes, somewhat willing to object, willing to say that he had to be the one to protect her; but hers did not waver, and her glare shut him down before he even dared argue.</p>
<p class=vb>“We are going to save him, and anyone else who needs saving,” she said gravely. “But we are going to do it only to the best of our abilities, not beyond. We are going to do it because we <i>can</i>, and not for any other reason. We are not going to take this as a personal burden, because even if we fail, it will <i>not</i> be our fault; and no matter how little time we have left, no matter if we are too late, we are <i>not</i> going underprepared and risk getting ourselves in danger as well. Is that clear?”</p>
<p class=vb>He opened his mouth again by reflex and inhaled sharply; but after a few seconds, he released his breath and agreed. The idea of possibly putting Claire or anyone else in danger was unbearable to him, and in this very situation when death could occur at any unknown moment, so was the idea of taking the time to think before acting. But this… was, objectively, a far more efficient and far safer method than to rush in and try to accomplish everything by himself. This also sounded like the best compromise—praying that the countdown before tragedy struck would be merciful enough to at least give them a chance.</p>
<p class=vb>Claire’s free hand picked up the hat and gently gave it to him, while the other left his grip and went to rest on his shoulder.</p>
<p class=vb>“Let’s talk to Clay,” she offered softly. “Then we will come up with a plan.”</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vs>Clay’s appearance had certainly shifted again while they had been left unsupervised; but since their form already had been a messy mashup of multiple materials, shapes and colours beforehand, the changes they had likely adopted during the young couple’s absence were neither easy to spot, nor worth looking into.</p>
<p class=vb>They still very much looked like a young, chubby child, for the most part. But any other pictures, textures, tinctures and other features which could have been used to capture their true structure, were about as unified and harmonious as would be the wild jungle of Hershel’s books and trinkets in his office after a month of intense and solitary studying; if not more.</p>
<p class=vs>More importantly, the first thing that the two adults noticed upon entering once again the living room, was the puzzle sitting on the surface of the wooden table, which the little shape-shifter was tentatively poking with intense curiosity in the eyes. By the looks of it, the puzzle had already been solved; but the entity’s interest towards it had not waned in the slightest, most likely because they could not think of anything better to do anyway.</p>
<p class=vs>They were scrutinising the puzzle’s indistinct form and far more distinctive oily essence with great interest, appearing to be intrigued and surprised when they found their fingers covered in the somewhat sticky dust that it left behind in its trail, not too dissimilar to the colourful powder left by the microscopic scales of a butterfly’s wings.</p>
<p class=vb>It was somewhat endearing, almost comical even, to see a physics-defying mystery inspect with such care and curiosity another analogous at first glance, yet distinctly different and so much more mundane oddity of the universe.</p>
<p class=vb>When Claire closed the door leading to the bedroom, Clay jumped in surprise and looked up at them with a fearful look, as if they believed that they had been caught red-handed while in the midst of committing a terrible crime.</p>
<p class=vb>“I, uh… I found it when I looked at the time,” they blabbered sheepishly, pointing upwards and at the clock sitting far above their head. Looking back down, the puzzle reflected a few blurry pictures containing circles, clock hands, and numbers going in twelves. This checked out. “I didn’t move from here, I promise! It just… I saw something strange when I looked at the clock, and…”</p>
<p class=vb>Hershel sighed and shook his head, a small relieved smile appearing on his face. “Solving a hidden puzzle is far more preferable than causing actual trouble,” he muttered reassuringly.</p>
<p class=vs>He still took a quick look around to see whether they had touched or broken anything they should have left alone, and would have been too ashamed to admit; but the state of the living room seemed, at least at first glance, to be in the exact same state as the mess he had left it in. He gave to the void a slight, satisfied nod, happy to see that nothing had been misplaced.</p>
<p class=vb>He was disorderly, sure; but it was his mess, and it was a mess in which he could find his bearings. Except during the few occasions when he needed to find a specific item he had not planned on searching for—but those were just a few times. Just a few times.</p>
<p class=vb>In any case; all things considered, it was an unexpected, but quite relieving and welcome surprise, to find out that Clay had, in fact, managed to not cause any more trouble while they were left unsupervised. The fact that they were genuinely apologetic for the events they had catalysed certainly lifted a small weight from his list of problems, and helped him regain a bit more of his usual serenity.</p>
<p class=vb>Clay looked reassured as well by his words, and as such decided to gently cup the puzzle and proudly show it to the two adults. The small blob of cosmic undefined matter curled around their fingers on the way, but as soon as they reached their destination, it quickly left the child to instead direct all of its attention to Hershel. Caught off-guard but not at all surprised, the young professor stifled a soft laugh and muttered that, all things considered, perhaps he did need a soothing brain-teaser to busy his hands with.</p>
<p class=vb>“It took me a while before I figured that I had to mirror the dial and turn it counterclockwise, but I was able to solve it!” they announced to Claire with pride, trying not to speak too loud so as to avoid ruining the twist for the one who was currently pondering about it.</p>
<p class=vb>“I believe you mean <i>anti</i>clockwise,” the woman laughed softly. “But, this is good to hear. Well done.”</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vs>As expected of the not yet famous, not quite yet Professor Layton, he had only needed a glance and a few dozen seconds before he could figure out the puzzle’s trick and exploit it. Hershel tried to look for the old faded encyclopaedia he had repurposed as a puzzle index so he could give this one a more permanent home, much less meddlesome and intruding than the one it had previously made for itself. But, to his dismay, it was not long into his search before the little wonder of the world lost patience, jumped off his shoulder, and scurried along his arm and back up the walls before lodging itself within the part of the clock’s shadow which was, at this current point in time, covering the right half of the <i>haniwa</i> standing by its side.</p>
<p class=vs>Having powerlessly followed it as best he could with his eyes all the way up to the top of the china cabinet and the highest point in the room closest to the ceiling, he opened his mouth in protest, but soon stopped himself and instead sighed dejectedly. He gave up trying to go after it for the time being, knowing that trying to pull it out of a metaphorical space defined by nothing but an illusory and transient absence of light would be out of his physical capabilities.</p>
<p class=vb>Then again, if the puzzle’s hiding spot was a shadow, then all he had to do to force it out was to move either the clock or the <i>haniwa</i> itself out of the way and directly into what little sunlight his window still provided at this hour, given the fact that the first hints of sunset were coming; but he shamefully admitted to himself that he was too lazy to climb on a chair and proceed, possibly at the risk of losing his balance when this puzzle (which, apparently, was quite the lively one) would most certainly jump out, with no warning and much grumpiness. The fact that he had his newly gifted top hat back on his head was, in that regard, another element that should deter him from diving into pointless acrobatics.</p>
<p class=vs>Hopefully, the funny little statuette would survive the puzzle-induced decay for a little while. Clark had gifted it to him after returning from an excavating site in Japan upon the pretense that this flat cut rectangle of terracotta clay had somehow reminded him of his college friend. Hershel would forever continue to insist that he and this old trinket looked nothing alike, and much to his chagrin, he seemed to be the only one holding this opinion; but he did always appreciate a gift from a good friend, and he tried to keep it in pristine condition, to the best of his ability.</p>
<p class=vb>Still… Given his state of mind, given his unwillingness to climb haphazardly and forcefully dislodge a puzzle (a risky mission which was almost as suicidal as the crime that was moving a sleeping cat away from its chosen resting spot), and given the fact that he had far more crucial matters to care for at the moment, he begrudgingly accepted to let this one remain for now in the realm of nature and freedom, and walked back to the chatting duo.</p>
<p class=vb>“Clay,” he announced gravely, “if you don’t mind… There is a lot we need to discuss.”</p>
<p class=vb>A shiver ran down their spine. They turned their head away from Claire and towards him, at first with apprehension; but thankfully, after seeing his serious, but perfectly calm and benevolent expression, they relaxed instantly and nodded. Taking in his words, they showed that they were just as determined to be helpful, as he was to save innocent lives.</p>
<p class=vb>“We need as much information about Desmond Sycamore as you can give us,” he continued. “Do you know where we would find him now? If he is an archaeologist, then surely he must be working alongside a university. Did he only ever study the Azran, and nothing else? Is he more of a geologist? A biologist? A linguist, perhaps?”</p>
<p class=vs>All of the child’s determination melted down upon hearing his questions. Needless to say, the unfortunate deduction to be made was that they did not have any clue as to what the answers could be.</p>
<p class=vb>Hershel was disappointed, but not too surprised. From what he had seen, their knowledge was extremely precise and accurate… But only if this was information they had had the chance of accessing in the first place. If Clay possessed his memories of a different time, and if his own self from said different time had never had the chance of learning these answers, then the poor messenger had no chance of being able to relay information they had never been granted.</p>
<p class=vb>“If we don’t even know which university he is affiliated to, then we will need to do quite a bit of research before we can do anything,” he sighed nervously. “If his works revolve primarily around the Azran, then I fear I am quite behind in terms of bibliography. Even if he published some articles already, finding them will not be an easy feat.”</p>
<p class=vb>“Perhaps you could ask someone about it?” his girlfriend offered with a small smile.</p>
<p class=vb>“Well, I do suppose I could ask Andrew the next time I see him…” he mused, stroking his chin with hope; but instantly letting his hand drop in sudden realisation. “Oh, no. What time is it?”</p>
<p class=vb>Three heads turned upwards and to the same clock that had earlier spawned a puzzle:</p>
<h2>August 22, 1953<br>06:42 PM<div class=hr></div></h2>
<p class=vb>“<i>Already!?</i>” the young professor choked. “We have to be there at eight!”</p>
<p class=vb>Clay stared at him in confusion, and so did Claire for the span of a single second; but as soon as she replayed in her mind the few words that had triggered his reaction, her face paled as well.</p>
<p class=vb>“The <i>dinner party</i>,” she gasped, slapping the palm of her hand against her forehead. “I completely forgot!”</p>
<p class=vb>“Andrew was the one who made the reservation,” Hershel muttered in panic. “It is far too late to cancel it, all the more if we…”</p>
<p class=vb>The physicist forcefully stood in front of him and scolded him gently. “Hershel, this party is for you! Cancelling it is out of the question, regardless of who organised it.”</p>
<p class=vs>The small shape-shifting child discreetly stepped away from the middle of the room and closer to a wall, watching with wide silent eyes the two young adults ramble about an event that they had no idea existed up until this very moment.</p>
<p class=vs>It took them about a minute of careful observation and deduction; but they were eventually able to catch up on the fact that, apparently, on the same day that Claire had gifted her boyfriend the top hat whose image had been ingrained so deeply into their mind, they had also planned to have dinner in a fancy restaurant with Doctor Schrader and the Tritons.</p>
<p class=vb>The mention of a dinner party rang a bell, somewhere in their memory; pulling to the forefront of their mind a few words that resounded clear as day, just as precise and reliable as an audio recorder:</p>
<p class=vb><i>Let’s continue this celebration over dinner tonight. Oh, and promise me you’ll wear the hat!</i></p>
<p class=vb>At first, they had assumed that this dinner would only have been meant to be between the two. But, thinking again, it could have made just as much sense to imagine that they would want to celebrate such a big step in the professor’s life with more friends—all the more if those friends were archaeologists as well. So, all things considered… Clay was surprised by this unforeseen development, but now understood the logic behind it.</p>
<p class=vb>That being said, this was not all. To add on to their worries, considering what time it was, and what time they were supposed to be there, they had just over an hour to get prepared and make their way to said restaurant; restaurant which, obviously, was <i>not</i> closeby, and would require either a bus or an underground trip eating away at even more of what little time separated them from their current deadline.</p>
<p class=vb>Clay thus understood a lot more why they had become so agitated all of a sudden, and decided to make themselves as discreet as possible, so as to not make them waste any more time.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vs>It did not take Claire too long to realise the exact reason why Hershel was so reluctant at the idea of coming to the party.</p>
<p class=vs>Well, obviously, there were far more than just one reason; but the most underlying one, the one unspoken but standing first in his mind, was most certainly related to one of the unpleasant life-shattering news he had learned during this afternoon. Namely, that they were meant to celebrate his becoming an archaeology professor… just a few hours after he learned that this career choice, which had never truly been his in the first place, was now for a useless cause.</p>
<p class=vb>This one emotional puzzle was quite tricky to solve; but, playing with words and scenarios in her mind as they both rushed back into his bedroom and started packing what he would need for the evening, she eventually crafted the best words of comfort and advice she could think of at the moment:</p>
<p class=vb>“Let’s celebrate not a new position; but how years of hard work and dedication were finally recognised and rewarded,” she said encouragingly with a bright, sincere smile. “We will celebrate your efforts. Your friendships. Your victories over every obstacle you overcame in your life. No matter what you choose from this day on, Hershel, your future will be bright.”</p>
<p class=vb>He tried his best to tune out her words and only focus on what needed to be done—they did not have much time, so if they wanted to at least be presentable when they would show up, he needed to stay focused for now. Still, his lips were hurting from trying to not smile too hard, and his cheeks were so red and flustered that he feared they could explode any moment.</p>
<p class=vb>“We will celebrate you, Hershel,” his sweetheart continued, and he knew that she was absolutely premeditating a murder by deliberately drowning him under as much corny love as she could throw at him. “Because you are a wonderful person, and we care about you. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for sharing your life with me; for it has never been so fulfilling until you came along.”</p>
<p class=vb>“Claire, you’re going to make me cry again…” As well as die of embarrassment, but she was observant enough to have noticed this already.</p>
<p class=vb>“Right, right,” she laughed softly. “That would not be ideal for now. But I do mean it.”</p>
<p class=vb>Seeing that he was now alright and willing to go, she planted a kiss on his cheek, then went back to the living room to get her lab coat.</p>
<p class=vb>“Clay, we only remembered just now that we had an important appointment at a restaurant tonight—”</p>
<p class=vb>The child nodded quickly, shifting their eyes embarrassingly to the side. “I figured from what you were saying. Um… Have fun?”</p>
<p class=vb>She kept the white coat neatly under her arm and fiddled with her pink necktie, looking straight at them with hesitation. “Yes, well… How about you? Perhaps you could come, but this is under such short notice, and…”</p>
<p class=vb>“No, I don’t even know if I could… hold myself together…” Part of their messy hair curled up into nervous orange swirls, and they pointed up at them as evidence to emphasise their point. “…Literally. But, I will be fine, don’t worry about me,” they assured with a shy but genuine smile on their face. “Please relax and celebrate. Especially after all that’s happened, you definitely need to take your mind off these things, I’m sure. And, well. It feels a bit weird for me to say, because he’s always been a professor to me, but… Congratulations to him? He really deserves the title.”</p>
<p class=vb>“That he does,” she nodded lovingly. “Still, what will you do in the meantime? Won’t you get bored?”</p>
<p class=vb>Clay looked around and shrugged. “There’s books. Probably more puzzles. And there’s my brain begging for some well awaited clean up. I’d like to get this whole…” Their pointing hand vaguely circled their own face. “…get this thing sorted out.”</p>
<p class=vb>Claire kept her lips closed in a thin line, studying the situation and their options carefully. “Speaking of… Clay, if you can keep your appearance stable for just a few minutes while we go outside, you should come with me. There is room in my flat, we shouldn’t impose on Hershel to look after you.”</p>
<p class=vb>“Actually, I would rather keep them here, if you don’t mind.”</p>
<p class=vs>Both woman and child jumped in surprise and turned around: speaking of the devil, the man of the day was now standing on the doorstep and had managed to get changed in record time.</p>
<p class=vb>He sent the small entity a deep look, which they seemed to understand. Regardless of whether taking care of them would be a burden or not, there was an undeniable fact that needed to be taken into account first: if he now completely trusted their knowledge to be accurate and reliable… He certainly did not trust them to keep quiet about it.</p>
<p class=vb>“Well,” his girlfriend muttered while shrugging, “if you’re sure, then… alright. We don’t have time to argue anyway, I still have to get prepared myself.”</p>
<p class=vb>“Yes, we should make haste, and I should definitely bring you some assistance in the process. After all, on average, it takes a woman much longer to get dressed,” he added smugly.</p>
<p class=vb>“How dare you disrespect a lady’s needs!” Claire laughed while throwing a light, painless hit in his shoulder. “Is this what a gentleman would say?”</p>
<p class=vb>“I was not being disrespectful,” he retorted with as much fake disrespect as he could muster, “I was merely reminding you of the statistics.”</p>
<p class=vb>“Why, you—!”</p>
<p class=vb>It was likely that their fake argument would continue, but the front door was closed, and therefore, Clay was left out of it.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vb>And so, once again, the small amnesiac shape-shifter was left on their own.</p>
<p class=vb>They had said that they knew what to busy themselves with, that they had many things to do, and they did; but now that they were indeed here, once again, in this empty living room… The first minute definitely felt unpleasantly familiar, and reminded them just a bit too much of the last time they had been alone in this room.</p>
<p class=vb>Still. Claire and the professor were doing alright. They had started to make jokes. They were fine. As such, it meant that they could relax, too. They had made some mistakes; they realised that it was surprisingly difficult to know the distinction between what needed to be said and what needed to be kept quiet at a given point in time, or between what someone was asking them to do and what this someone really needed for their own well-being… But they would learn to do better.</p>
<p class=vb>They figured that they would also have to… practice.</p>
<p class=vs>They stared down at their hands, winced at the unrecognisable mess that they could only imagine their current body looked like in this moment; and decided that this had to be mended in one way or another, preferably as fast as possible.</p>
<p class=vs>It only occurred to them, just in this instant, that not even once had they found any fully reflective surface until then. There had been the bus’ windows when they had travelled from Claire’s lab and to this place; but at that stage, they had been trying their best to not look at anything, period. And now, in the professor’s flat… They turned to the china cabinet, having noticed that its glass windows were reflective to some extent, if only slightly due to the small amount of dust covering their surface.</p>
<p class=vb>They could use this. Still, this was barely reflective enough to hint at nothing but greyish shapes; and even if it had been a perfect mirror… they had not dared take a look just yet, and they certainly did not feel ready now. Having watched the adults’ looks of sheer horror and disgust was enough to imagine the worst.</p>
<p class=vb>They wanted something—a face—that they would truly be able to call theirs. But where and how could they find such a thing?</p>
<p class=vs>While looking down and away from the cabinet’s glass windows, their eyes fell onto the one thing they had brought along with them, and absent-mindedly left on their chair while they had been busy with the hidden puzzle: a strange, rectangular, closed black pouch.</p>
<p class=vs>They gulped; hesitated for a few long moments of undefined duration, unsure as to whether this was a good or terrible idea; hesitated even more… But eventually gave in to temptation, carefully picked it up, and set it down on the table in front of them.</p>
<p class=vs>It felt strange to realise that this was only the second time that they ever opened it; the first time had been for just a brief handful of seconds, yet the image of what they had seen in it had been burned into their mind, and they could recall it just as clearly as any other memory they still had—which was all at the same time absolutely nothing prior to the moment they had woken up in the laboratory… and, on the other hand, far too many things that had no right to be called ‘memories.’</p>
<p class=vb>A lump formed in their throat as they looked down for the second time, and saw once again the words written on all these strange squared gizmos; the exact same words that had caused them such panic and anguish ever since they had laid eyes upon them.</p>
<p class=vb>As surprising as it may sound to anyone else… Clay actually did not have a single clue what these things were, let alone what they were doing here.</p>
<p class=vb>Well, to be more precise: they had a very, very strong suspicion, regarding what these things <i>contained</i>—that was to say, most likely, precisely the exact same knowledge that had somehow been forced into their mind, and perhaps even more of it. But this said nothing of what sort of terrifying device this was, or how one would operate it, or why it had been made in the first place.</p>
<p class=vb>The only thing they had recognised, and the only reason they knew that this pouch was bad news, were the words written by a careless and hasty hand on these sticky notes. There had been six small colourful sheets of paper, duct taped to six little metallic squares, with six pairs of words written on each… And the fact that these six pairs of words were somehow key words that helped them classify these strange pictures and sounds they had in mind could not have been mere coincidence.</p>
<p class=vs>It was exactly as they had told the professor: they knew. They could not explain it, they could not explain what it was, or how, or why; but they knew.</p>
<p class=vb>They knew, because what they were looking at was an exact copy of their own mind—as well as a bigger, thicker device which seemed capable of giving it form.</p>
<p class=vb>When the professor had made them realise that his memories had been stolen and forcefully transferred into another person’s brain, up to the point that this person would then forget everything about their own identity and somehow end up naming themselves after a stupid pile of dirt, they had understood what his feeling of utter fear and absolute vulnerability were like. Because this machine, which perhaps could just as well have been the exact same machine that had thrown the professor’s memories into their head in the first place, was doing the exact same thing; and because this machine’s way of sharing its knowledge was far more direct than to simply listen to someone talking about them.</p>
<p class=vs>Clay took a deep breath, forcefully trying to shake their fears away. They had opened this horrible thing again for a reason, and hopefully, this reason would be useful.</p>
<p class=vs>They knew what the key words were. They did not know why they instinctively wanted to connect each key word with a specific colour, but the sticky notes were doing it as well.</p>
<p class=vs>They knew which key word, and which colour, contained the information they wanted.</p>
<p class=vb>They picked up the navy blue square without hesitation, seized and flipped open the bigger device with its one heavy cathode-ray tube screen and weird keyboard, found after a few seconds of keen observation a square-shaped hole on its left side, and inserted the former inside the latter.</p>
<p class=vb>This being done, it took them a bit more time before they figured out how to turn it on; but they eventually found a switch, pressed it, and watched the old blinking screen spark to life. Clay waited; and after a few more moments, they heard an ominous, jittering tune, and were faced with the image of a dark blue night sky, a looming black ghost, and some of the words that brought them the most fear of all:</p>
<h1><span>Professor Layton and the</span><br>Specter’s Flute<br><span>©1966 StarRaid Inc.</span></h1>
<p class=vb>Quite a handful of people in their place would have been shocked at this sight; and, in some way, the small amnesiac stranger in search for a face of their own was shocked as well. But they were shocked neither because they would not have expected it, nor because the words or numbers would have been any different from the ones they had expected to see; far on the contrary, they were shocked, but actually quite numb, really, to realise with fatality and despair that everything they were seeing was exactly as they had pictured it—exactly as it had been standing in their mind all along.</p>
<p class=vb>At least… The silver lining was that if everything unpleasant had been exactly as they had predicted it, then hopefully, so would be the part they were hoping to find helpful in this precise moment.</p>
<p class=vs>Now… There were a lot of buttons. This was not a regular keyboard, the device was far too small for that; but it did contain multiple keys with multiple meanings… And since they had never seen this device before, let alone used it, deducing the role of each button would not be easy.</p>
<p class=vb>They found the central button, a circle standing in the midst of smaller squares, to be more suspicious than the others; and thankfully, after pressing it, they found the words they had been looking for:</p>
<h2>▸<i>London Life</i></h2>
<p class=vb>The buttons surrounding the circle had little triangles drawn on them, and they thus deduced that they should be used as arrows. Soon, they were thus able to access the contents hidden behind these two words; and after a few more button presses, they were soon faced with a single sentence:</p>
<p class=writing style=font-family:Consolas><d>First, you will need to create your<br>character to get started on your new life.</d></p>
<p class=vs>They snorted nervously. That sounded about right.</p>
<p class=vb>Those were, as always, words that they knew by heart and had expected to see, always without being able to truly tell where they could have possibly seen them before; but finding them once again here, not inside the depths of their mind but directly written on the singular cathodic screen of this rusty metallic device, made them feel like the world itself was mocking them.</p>
<p class=vb>Still, here it finally was: dozens of combinations of appearances to choose from, of which none belonged to anybody. Of which, perhaps, hopefully, one would become theirs.</p>
<p class=vb>Clay experimented with a few more buttons, trying progressively to understand how the inputs functioned and interacted with the data itself, and getting somewhat confused upon seeing that despite being the exact same data, the logic behind accessing it was sometimes different from what they would have intuitively thought; but they managed to wrap their mind around this oddity, and to eventually create a map of correlations between causation and effect. After all, in the end, it should be obvious to anyone that information classified within a machine should not be accessed through the same logic as it would be within the mind; and having it clearly visible on a physically tangible screen was what made these faces all the more interesting to take as inspiration, since it would make it far easier for them to only focus on one at a time.</p>
<p class=vs>Quite a few hours ago already, all the way back to the moment when they had been abandoned in an unfamiliar (yet far too familiar) place with nothing but these strange memories and this pouch to prove that they were real… The conclusion that Clay had reached after thinking again and again about this specific set of words and what information was hiding behind it, was that, realistically speaking, ‘London Life’ and all that it entailed should not exist.</p>
<p class=vb>Out of all the memories that these incomprehensible metallic squares contained, this was by far the oddest. This one simply felt out of place; they had reasoned that since it revolved around creating a person that did not exist originally, yet altered a long chain of events, then this could not be reality. And yet, since everything else had turned out to be the truth… What was the purpose of this? They simply did not understand. The purpose of the memories felt obvious: they told the past and future alike, and since the very first thing they had done was to accidentally change History for the better, before they even had been fully conscious, then it was logical to conclude that they had been entrusted with the mission to use them in order to make things better. But… this?</p>
<p class=vb>The fact alone that they somehow <i>knew</i> that they would find this strange, out of place data, and yet that they could not even fathom how they could have possibly known as such when they had never even seen these devices in their life, was nonsensical. They had gaps in their memory, obviously; yet they also felt so adamant about what they knew… This was the kind of inconsistency that they could simply not explain to themselves, and that the professor had treated as highly abnormal.</p>
<p class=vs>They would have gladly asked him what he would think of this, if only this did not mean exposing him to… even more unpleasant things. If they ever were to tell him about this specific puzzle, then they certainly would wait at least until a moment when he would seem able to handle it. They certainly were not eager to have him know that the actual reason why they wanted Desmond Sycamore’s family to be rescued… was so he could prevent his brother from turning into an evil mastermind. Or that Randall was alive, yes, but that thanks to said lost-brother-turned-evil, he would turn evil too. Or that the only way he had been able to save the world in the Sanctuary was to literally die.</p>
<p class=vb>Really, he… They did not want to specifically <i>hide</i> things from him, but… those were simply things that he did not need to know for the sake of his own sanity. Clay had learned during the past few hours that they were not the brightest, but even they could figure out this much.</p>
<p class=vb>Oh, well. They would try to solve this mystery on their own in the meantime, and for this specific moment, they could at least find a purpose for it. If this part of the data was about creating a new, fake life… Then this was exactly what they needed.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vb>It had taken them quite a while to find a combination that would please them; and, to be quite frank, they still were not satisfied with this one either… But, unfortunately for them, they were not exactly in a position to be picky.</p>
<p class=vb>Copying a semi-abstract patchwork of millimetric coloured squares was far more complicated than copying the portraits of a real live person; but they found respite in the idea that, at least, this left them with more than enough freedom to simply imagine their own missing details—and that, hopefully, ‘imagining’ meant ‘making the result all the more personal.’</p>
<p class=vb>They closed their eyes. Took a deep breath. Stood up from the chair and went to face the glass…</p>
<p class=vs>The person staring back at them was unrecognisable. The realisation that this was <i>them</i> was jarring; but at least, they were looking at a human being. This was better than nothing.</p>
<p class=vb>It did fit their expectations, it did come from the crude, microscopic jigsaw that they had taken as inspiration, and it did look nothing like any of the people they had previously met, or expected to ever meet in the future. But… it simply did not feel like ‘them’, either.</p>
<p class=vb>Still. Being a ‘nobody’ definitely was an improvement over being ‘someone else.’</p>
<p class=vb>As they were sitting back down at the table and contemplating whether there could be more improvements to be added, the front door opened without warning, and none other than Professor Hershel Layton walked in at a fast pace.</p>
<p class=vb>After jumping out of their ever-changing skin, Clay mindlessly seized the pouch and closed it with force, hardly pondering whether it could have damaged its contents in the process. Frankly, if the device became unusable for one reason or another, it probably would not have been that big of a loss, considering the potential gains of finally being rid of such abominable thing.</p>
<p class=vb>“My apologies for the lack of warning,” the owner of the flat said while making a beeline through the living room and into his bedroom, “but I forgot something important,” he then said while making the exact same beeline in the opposite direction, nervously trying to fit a tiny cubic velvet box inside one of his fancy black suit’s pockets. “I hope I didn’t startle you,” he apologised promptly, stopping on the doorstep for but the single second required to obtain a reply.</p>
<p class=vb>They stared at him with terror in their blank eyes, like a deer on the road. “…Professor,” they simply sputtered, too shocked to come up with any more words; and once again upon hearing this new nickname, the man cringed slightly.</p>
<p class=vb>The surprise had been frightening enough for Clay’s current disguise to partially decompose, their hair switching from blonde to brown, with always the same top hat suddenly raising from it. Sighing dejectedly, they squinted up at the new addition, carefully removed it from their head, and held it against their chest while muttering that, no, he needed not worry, they had not been startled. Hershel wished he could forget the uncanny way this fake hat had been separated from their skull, and unsee the strange liquified substance that had connected the two and was, for but a short time, neither hat nor hair.</p>
<p class=vb>“I was…” Clay briefly looked down at the now semi-closed pouch, then back up at him, and pointed an uncertain index finger at their face. “…looking for inspiration,” they mumbled guiltily.</p>
<p class=vb>The young professor looked down as well, and his face tensed all at once. He opened his mouth, as he seemed to consider saying something, but not a single sound came out; and after a short hesitation, he bent down and picked up a small red square that had fallen on the ground. When Clay realised what this meant, embarrassment flustered all over their face when they turned back to look up at him sheepishly.</p>
<p class=vb>Really, Hershel knew that he had to be going—Claire was waiting for him downstairs, and they had a bus to catch. But if he could just stay for one single minute…</p>
<p class=vs>Whoever had made this tiny device had carelessly taped a vermilion sticker on it and written in black ink the words <i>‘Devil’s Box’</i> in a hasty, negligent handwriting. Two words on a stained sticky note that was ready to fall off, and nothing more.</p>
<p class=vs>Evidently, fate itself had decided to agree with the decision he had already taken, and confirm his suspicions. Such a diabolical ‘box’ this tiny black rectangle was, indeed. The current situation was rather reminiscent of the tale of Pandora’s box from Greek mythology, he found himself thinking with a strange mixture between amusement and apprehension.</p>
<p class=vb>In any case, the message that serendipity had left him was clear: he should not pry any further, lest he regret it for the fourth time in a row. Had he had any remaining curiosity to look further into the mystery of the pouch and what exactly it contained, it definitely was now gone for good.</p>
<p class=vb>He still had not uncovered the entirety of this mystery; most of it was completely shrouded in darkness, to be quite honest. But he had solved the puzzle of his personal feelings, and the answer was that <i>he did not want to solve this one, ever</i>.</p>
<p class=vb>Clay gulped and timidly pointed at the chunk of metal that he was busy staring at. “This…&nbsp;one… would probably have records for that case where you tried to find a cursed box that kills anyone who tries to open it.”</p>
<p class=vs>If the ‘curiosity killed the cat’ message that fate had decided to leave on his path were not already clear enough before, it certainly was now. How kind of Miss Fortune to be as subtle as a screaming elephant riding a bicycle through a beehive today.</p>
<p class=vb>He put the little red square down on the table, then crossed his arms severely and looked down at the small entity.</p>
<p class=vb>“So this is just as I thought,” he muttered tensely. On the bright side: the one thing he could deduce from this little square’s existence was actually removing one of the fears he had, rather than adding yet another pile of worries to the list.</p>
<p class=vb>“All I know is that nobody should see it. I was using it to look for a face, but perhaps… Perhaps it’d be safer to just destroy it.”</p>
<p class=vb>He cocked his head to the side and raised an unimpressed eyebrow. “In this case, why don’t you do it?”</p>
<p class=vb>They looked down in shame. “It’s… It might be the only thing that has more clues,” they asserted hesitantly, but convinced of their words. “I… I know that everything I know now—it’s inside of it too. I just… don’t know <i>why</i>, or <i>how</i>, and… I’ve just been wondering if, perhaps, it had <i>more</i>. I already forgot everything about myself, and the events I have in mind… There are gaps in time between them. If I was given your memories, why would there be holes in them? What if this thing has information on what’s missing?” They gulped. Their lips trembling, they timidly raised their head back up to give the man a pleading look: “And… since it has information about everyone, then… What if it has something about <i>me</i>, too?”</p>
<p class=vs>The young professor, still crossing his arms with a stern expression, nodded once. This had been one of the more likely hypotheses he had kept in mind while asking his question, and was as such somewhat reassured to see that they were on the same page regarding this point.</p>
<p class=vb>If such records could contain major information that Clay was lacking, and if they were to avert disasters on a massive scale while using this information as the basis, then destroying them was far too premature. Nonetheless… He could not bring himself to look at this mine of information in person, and he could not help but feel doubtful of the child’s conclusions.</p>
<p class=vs>They were saying that there were holes in their memory; that they could not trust it due to how much they had forgotten. And yet, whenever they were recalling events, their confidence upon telling them was absolute. It was likely that they were not realising this specific contradiction due to their youth and immaturity, but the fact that they could be all at the same time so unsure of what they knew or could be lacking, and yet so adamant regarding the details of the events they talked about… Something truly was amiss. It was simply impossible to have such a clear, binary barrier between what they remembered, and what they had forgotten.</p>
<p class=vb>The gaps in their knowledge, and the fact that they could not tell where this knowledge came from, were the source of their general lack of confidence; but the facts themselves were crystal clear in their memory. There was no in-between; either they knew something fully, or they did not know anything about it, save for the deductions and guesses they reached, whether on their own or thanks to his help.</p>
<p class=vb>This… this was not how memory was meant to function. Either this was a side-effect of the memory tampering they had gone through, or… Once again, there was something more to it; something that this child was far from suspecting.</p>
<p class=vb>In any case. The conclusion was, simply put, that he was not convinced in the slightest that this device’s records contained anything that Clay did not already have in mind, and that as such, theoretically, they did not need this pouch at all.</p>
<p class=vs>But… He did understand their reasoning, and was neither ready to take the risk, nor willing to pass up the opportunity of having a source of information that would most likely be far more organised than the convoluted summaries spouted by Clay’s mouth.</p>
<p class=vb>…This still did not mean that he would ever feel the desire to look into these records himself. Perhaps he would, one day. But that day was certainly not today. In fact, it would probably not come before a week or two. Make that months. Perhaps an entire year. Just any amount of time he needed to sort out the things he had already learned, and make some room for what was likely to be an even bigger number of things he would much rather live without knowing.</p>
<p class=vb>“I… I-I swear I don’t know how this thing can even <i>exist</i>,” the child sighed in shame and confusion, probably distraught by his prolonged silence and willing to end it by any means necessary.</p>
<p class=vs>He looked again at the red square he had left on the table, and once again reminded himself of what this all meant.</p>
<p class=vs>The reassuring part was that, contrary to what he had previously believed, it actually seemed now possible, likely even, that every single piece of information that had been entrusted to Clay was contained within this one pouch, and that there were no other sources of this knowledge elsewhere. Every single piece of information that had been stolen from him was now under this roof, safe within the confines of his apartment, and under his own care.</p>
<p class=vb>…The frightening part was the fact that such records had been created at all.</p>
<p class=vs>How did this device function? Who had created it, and with what purpose? Just how much information did it contain? In all honesty, he was too tired to care.</p>
<p class=vb>Three times he had insisted. Three times he had regretted it. It took some effort… but he succeeded in convincing his mind that ultimately, <i>he did not want to know</i>.</p>
<p class=vb><i>“I give up,”</i> he painfully managed to not say out loud. <i>“Not a single thing about you makes sense. I don’t know how <b>you</b> can exist.”</i></p>
<p class=vb>Instead, he inhaled sharply, looked up to meet Clay’s eyes, looked down at the half-closed pouch again, then back up at the person holding it.</p>
<p class=vb>“Do you still need it?”</p>
<p class=vb>They looked down and to the side; pursed their lips, considering their options; took a slow, unsure breath.</p>
<p class=vb>“…Probably not,” they admitted truthfully.</p>
<p class=vb>“Good.”</p>
<p class=vb>Hershel picked up the red square, offered an open and demanding hand to Clay until they hesitantly gave him the half-closed pouch, put the tiny square inside the pouch, closed the pouch, walked through the entire apartment with the pouch, opened a drawer in his bedroom with the hand that was not holding the pouch, practically threw the accursed pouch inside the drawer, closed the drawer, locked the drawer with a key, shoved the key in his pocket. And then a long, winded sigh of utter relief and satisfaction left his lungs.</p>
<p class=vb>When he walked out of his bedroom and looked at the child again, they were trying to look at their foggy reflection in the glass of the china cabinet’s panes. At first, he did not say a word; but upon realising that he was back in the living room, their frightened and guilty expression was back once again. His face tensing up again, he sighed; then said that, if they needed a mirror, they could find one in the bathroom.</p>
<p class=vb>The shape-shifter blinked in surprise; but soon, they timidly stood up from the chair and followed him there. As promised, right in front of the tap, a mirror hung on the wall; tall enough to show two thirds of a body; clear enough for the reflection of a person that did not exist to come alive, stare in shock, and shriek.</p>
<p class=vb>The young professor looked at them sympathetically. “…I’m sure you will find it someday,” he eventually muttered in a somewhat reassuring tone.</p>
<p class=vb>Bending their neck down so they would avoid the sight, they stared down at the fake hat; realising that they still had yet to get rid of it this time. “Find what?”</p>
<p class=vb>He repressed a short, humourless laugh. “Yourself, I suppose. In more ways than one.”</p>
<p class=vb>And a few seconds later, from a few dozen feet away, the front door closed once again.</p>
