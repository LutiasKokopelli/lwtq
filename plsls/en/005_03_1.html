<p class=vb>“How about ‘Ashley’, then? Ashley sounds nice.”</p>
<p class=vs>The amnesiac young stranger lowered a thoughtful gaze and let out an audible breath through their nose; but once again, the few seconds of silence spent stroking their chin with a sad and indecisive look were enough for Claire to understand that, once again, this offer was not to their liking either. The black pouch was now sitting on their lap, covered on one side by one of their hands; and as they were deep in thought, a thin, pale index nervously tapped its dull surface in a somewhat irregular rhythm.</p>
<p class=vb>As they had mentioned right from the start, even before they left the laboratory, the name ‘Celeste’ was far from satisfying them; and they were quite relieved that they had never met the need to use it at all.</p>
<p class=vs>The prospect of forging a new name from scratch, a name which was very unlikely to truly be theirs either, did not appeal to them that much more. But the child had reluctantly come to terms with the idea that their true identity would remain a mystery for quite a long time, and that this was the best solution they had. At least, this time, the choice of this temporary substitute was truly in their hands.</p>
<p class=vb>All had decided unanimously to only look into androgynous names: after all, man, woman, or other, even this aspect of their identity was unknown to them.</p>
<p class=vb>“Perhaps we should find a more efficient method than listing what comes to us spontaneously,” the archaeologist eventually said. He put down his teacup back on the table in front of him and stood up silently, adding: “Let me see if I can find my dictionary.”</p>
<p class=vs>His girlfriend’s face lit up, congratulating him on his initiative, and she immediately came to follow him. The two quickly came to stand in front of one of the many shelves overflowing with books that the room contained, and split up the work. They started searching in and around the shelves, and it took about two short minutes before Claire started teasing him about his incorrigible lack of organisation skills.</p>
<p class=vb>The entity found themselves alone at the table, their almost full teacup in their hands, letting its soft warmth permeate their fingers. Discreetly, they looked at the two with a timid, but happy smile.</p>
<p class=vs>Just like Claire, it appeared that the professor had accepted the situation in no time, and had taken them in without question, as strange as it might be. The initial shock had been immense, unsurprisingly; and yet, the immeasurable help that his deductions had granted them, without him expecting anything in return, having done so only out of sheer generosity… ‘Grateful’ was far too weak a word to describe their feelings. After some time, all it took was a bit of tea for a sweet and bitter aroma to fill the air, and the tension and embarrassment had gradually faded away.</p>
<p class=vb>Truly, they had both come to terms with the idea that such a strange mystery could exist and be standing under their roof with bewildering speed. How could they look at them eye to eye, and shrug it off so easily? Part of them almost wondered if they were merely pretending to be alright with it, so as to not inconvenience their guest… But whichever the reason was, the guest in question was definitely not going to complain.</p>
<p class=vb>The child still felt lost, and part of them was almost ready to give up on the idea that they would ever gain any answers regarding their origins. But this part of them, far from being solely pessimistic, was in reality sufficiently satiated, if only in this simple, fleeting moment, by a completely different idea: the idea that they could experience the present, without worry about either the past or future. Sitting here, at this charming little wooden table, in this charming little living room, which felt a little cramped but still welcoming, looking at these two lovebirds who were such brilliant and lucid minds, yet all at the same time such sweet and naïve people, so far from possibly imagining the magnitude of the catastrophe that had almost separated them forever, in the most tragic way possible… They were almost starting to think that maybe, just maybe…</p>
<p class=vs>No, they would have never dared to say that they felt at home; but these two people, whom they had just met, yet who nevertheless were not at all strangers to them… Claire Foley and Hershel Layton, in this charming little unpretentious London apartment, behaved as if they belonged in such a place. As if it were normal that they would be here, in their home, watching them with a tender silence and a blissful smile.</p>
<p class=vb>It was not true, and they knew it far too well; the little black pouch sitting on their lap was definite proof of that, as well as a cruel reminder of what reality truly was. But… these two young adults had quite the talent for making them forget what little they knew, and believe otherwise.</p>
<p class=vb>The archaeologist finally got his hands on the long-awaited dictionary; but rather than returning to sit down at the table immediately, the couple continued talking to each other fondly, now back to listing names and sharing their thoughts on each of them. By listening to their enthusiasm, one could almost wonder if they had forgotten the very existence of the one they were supposed to name in the first place, and had instead started thinking of someone else entirely.</p>
<p class=vs>Without realising it, the shape-shifter’s mind had meanwhile started wandering around, taking a growing interest in their surroundings. The first detail they noticed was the abundance of books and paper, piled up here and there, filling up every empty space on the floor or in the corners between two shelves. But the large windows which overlooked the professor’s green-grey desk let the sun shine through, shedding into the room the soft warmth of a balmy late August afternoon: golden rays and light from the still blue sky filled the apartment with their brilliant but subdued colours, which maintained the illusion that the room seemed much more spacious than it truly was.</p>
<p class=vs>Many archaeological finds of all eras and shapes were hiding in every corner, and the entity was entertained by the thought that any excavation had to first begin in your own office, as you would attempt to remember where the artefact that you were supposed to study had been stored the last time you needed it. They found themselves searching for them, hoping to count them and find them all, like a young child looking for Easter eggs in the garden. Some were proudly displayed on their shelves, but many others were far less fortunate and found themselves, probably by accident, partially or completely crushed under piles of books—which, incidentally, had probably not been put back in their proper place either. A small smile escaped them when they noticed that some books had almost identical covers, and titles that seemed to indicate that they were part of the same series; and yet, that each volume was located in a different shelf altogether.</p>
<p class=vb>This place felt cosy and welcoming; and more than just this, it felt personal and sincere. It was humble, without pretention: in other words, it reflected the professor perfectly. And if only in this precise moment… They wouldn’t have wanted it any other way.</p>
<p class=vs>Still in the midst of their lost and directionless thoughts, the entity found themselves by chance crossing the gaze of a certain flat piece of pottery, which very vaguely resembled a human face sporting a funny expression; its silly carved eyes looking unfocused, and a naïve hole shaped like a smile plastered on its surface. Sitting at the top of a tall wardrobe, right next to a charming wooden clock, the pair of items was peacefully contemplating the living room from their prominent place, less than a foot away from reaching the ceiling.</p>
<p class=vs>The shape of this little statuette was somewhat distorted, either by the ravages of time that its companion would hammer in at every second in loving silence, or by the clumsiness of the hands that had originally crafted it. And yet, those very imperfections were what made it look sympathetic and friendly; it was likeable in its awkwardness, if this could make any sense. They caught themselves smiling at it, as if it could somehow respond.</p>
<p class=vb>This craft was by no means particularly intricate, and neither did it look special in any way; and yet, a certain familiarity emanated from it, when they looked at it face to face. This silly expression, this material, this small, dull and discreet form; among many other things, it reminded them of the infinite malleability of…</p>
<p class=vb>“Clay.”</p>
<p class=vb>Two interjections of slight surprise echoed in unison at the back of the room, as both scholars turned their heads back towards them.</p>
<p class=vb>“Clay?” Claire parroted, curious to hear them after such a long silence from their part. “As in ‘Clayton’…?” She turned to her boyfriend and laughed frankly, but tenderly. “That would be rather redundant, wouldn’t it?”</p>
<p class=vb>“No, just Clay.” They stared down, frowning and pursing their lips with always that same expression of doubt and, in some way… resignation. “I don’t know,” they added, “it just… It seems fitting.”</p>
<p class=vb>The couple exchanged a wordless look. Deciding to respect their choice, Claire closed the dictionary and put it back in its proper place—knowing full well that the next time she or someone else would need it, it probably would no longer be there. Hershel stifled a quiet chuckle, then turned to them with a soft smile, approaching the table again and taking a seat. He gave a slight encouraging nod—and adjusted his top hat in response, though this time, it seemed as if the gesture had been made without the slightest trace of frustration, and perhaps even without him realising that he had made it. Evidently, by sheer force of repetition and a habit that was gradually setting in, he was finally starting to tame his new accessory, step by step.</p>
<p class=vb>“Alright then,” he concluded, his smile growing wider. “It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Clay.”</p>
<p class=vb>The newly named entity smiled back with much less assurance; but despite their shyness, the warmth that emanated from their expression was sincere. They jokingly brought a hand to their chest, and bowed slightly in amusement.</p>
<p class=vb>“The pleasure’s all mine, Professor!” they laughed.</p>
<p class=vb>The man’s smile dropped all at once. Contrary to their intent and expectations, and to their great surprise… The reaction that these few words, which had been uttered as a joke, had provoked in the abovementioned professor, was one of complete shock… and of an equally incongruous suspicion, which slowly appeared on his pale face.</p>
<p class=vb>“Did you say ‘Professor’…?”</p>
<p class=vb>“Well, yes?” they immediately replied, raising both their eyebrows and shoulders in a confused shrug. “Everybody calls you that.”</p>
<p class=vb>“Nobody calls me that,” he bluntly replied, shaking his head. “I haven’t even started teaching yet.”</p>
<p class=vb>Claire took a short but deep inhale, then silently set her teacup back on the table. Motionless, out of the corner of her eyes, she sent the stranger a suddenly cold and calculating look: unlike her boyfriend, there was not a single ounce of surprise in her gaze.</p>
<p class=vb>“I was willing to wait a little longer and see if you would have brought up the topic on your own,” she justified with a deceptively light tone. “But since we reached this point… It might be time for you to tell us the whole truth, don’t you think? Right from the start, even before you spoke to us, you already seemed to know a lot about us. You knew Hershel, you knew about the hat… The list could go on. So… where did you learn all this?”</p>
<p class=vb>They should have known.</p>
<p class=vb>They should have known that Hershel Layton and Claire Foley were much smarter than they were. They had both kept their questions to themselves, deliberately, with the purpose of putting them at ease and lowering their guard; but not for a single moment had their oddities escaped their attention, and now…</p>
<p class=vb>Now was the time to be questioned.</p>
<p class=vb>Feeling cornered, a shiver ran down their spine. Before they knew it, their anxiousness had gotten the better of them, and despite the fact that they had realised that they had started shifting forms again, they found themselves powerless to stop it. If anything, their realisation only increased their panic all the more, thus making them lose what little control they still had over their appearance.</p>
<p class=vb>“Ack—No!” A great struggle erupted for a few agonisingly long seconds, as Clay tried to cling to any stable identity, any shred of consistency; but panic soon overcame them completely, and they gave up, burying a shapeless head inside an eternally changing pair of hands, expressing their despair through a whisper filled with shame and anguish. “Not again…!”</p>
<p class=vb>Having once again lost all sense of stability in their appearance, what now looked like a boiling mass of an undefined substance brought equally undefined legs against a torso that was soon to be hidden entirely in the shadows. At the same time, two arms that were shaking in much more than the first sense of the term came to wrap their entire body… and finally, the sorry spectacle displayed nothing but some kind of amorphous, ever shifting ball of terror and despair, at the centre of which now stood the little black pouch, always this mysterious pouch whose secrets had obviously become so heavy and crucial.</p>
<p class=vb>Neither Hershel nor Claire had expected this outburst, which had been equally sudden and excessive. The mere sight of this horrifying display was enough to freeze them in place, and it alone almost managed to make them forget the very reason why it had been triggered. Needless to say, both adults regretted having asked their questions so abruptly—although, in their opinion, they had nevertheless gone about it with enough caution and politeness to maintain a calm and constructive conversation, having had no intent of instigating a blatant questioning session.</p>
<p class=vs>Being frank and direct was a very effective and recommended method when it came to handling young children, all the more if some concepts and long sentences could be too complex for them to understand. However, the couple had forgotten that they were not facing a normal child; but rather, that they were facing a child who could change their shape through a quite disturbing process, and who moreover had the unfortunate tendency to trigger this phenomenon at the slightest sign of anxiety. An anxiety which, perhaps in part because of their personality, probably more because of the events they had been through less than two hours ago, could emerge at the slightest sign of discomfort, as benign as it seemed.</p>
<p class=vs>Admittedly, they had not at all expected that their words would be taken with this much gravity… But in view of such an overreaction, in view of how much they seemed to have lost their composure with only a few sentences from their part, even before they had the time to give more details… It was now obvious that they were far from having a clear conscience, and that the secret they were hiding was much larger and heavier to bear than they had thought.</p>
<p class=vb>Regardless… Clearly, if they were hoping to obtain their new friend’s full cooperation, resorting to parental authority was the wrong approach. At least, in view of the attitude of this child who seemed invaded by a kind of trauma of undefined nature and origin… It was far too early.</p>
<p class=vb>Claire shakily stood up, gritting her teeth when she heard her chair squeak against the parquet, and tried to somehow pacify the entity with as much sweetness and gentleness as she could—but her panic still prevented her from expressing them as much as she would have preferred.</p>
<p class=vb>“Calm down, we’re not accusing you of anything…!”</p>
<p class=vb>In all honesty, perhaps it had in fact been the case, until just a few seconds ago. But with this nauseating spectacle that had the talent for making them regret having ingested so much tea during the past half hour, it had suddenly become the least of their worries. If this overreaction and its disastrous consequences had been a deliberate tactical deterrent from Clay’s part, it was a resounding success.</p>
<p class=vs>She glanced helplessly at Hershel, silently calling for help; but she only found him even more distraught than she already was. She had to remind herself that, contrary to her, this was the first time that he was cursed with such an accidentally sordid scene.</p>
<p class=vb>Her eyes now back to the entity, she slowly sat back down and tried as best she could to bring back some sanity and calm around the table.</p>
<p class=vb>“Back in the lab, when you took on this new appearance… You admitted right away that you had seen it before,” she said with a friendly and encouraging tone, though her diction was still slightly too fast to sound natural. “You could’ve taken Dimitri’s compliment when he asked you if you had imagined it from nothing, it even would’ve been easier for you! But you didn’t.”</p>
<p class=vb>Once again casting a quick glance at her boyfriend, she was glad to see his face light up, proving that he had understood perfectly what this meant. Now that she had shared a clue that had eluded him due to his absence from the scene, but which now completely turned the situation around, the man traded what little severity he had managed to maintain so far, for the first signs of an awkward sweetness, albeit one which still retained some confused and cautious concern.</p>
<p class=vb>“Ah, I see now… Forgive me for not having understood sooner,” he said with a somewhat relieved sigh. “This proves rather well that you had no real intention of hiding anything from us, doesn’t it? You simply didn’t feel ready to talk about it just yet. Is that it?”</p>
<p class=vb>Slowly and timidly, two trembling wet eyes peeked out of a pair of crossed arms, which were still busy guarding the fortress that formed their entire body.</p>
<p class=vb>“I… I-it’s quite… difficult to explain,” they muttered in shame, stammering and stumbling on each syllable partly because of their unstable voice. “I’m not sure… if it’s a good idea.”</p>
<p class=vb>“We have time. There is no rush,” Hershel assured with as gentle a tone as possible, trying as best he could not to show the unpleasant turmoil that this sight was causing in his stomach.</p>
<p class=vs>It took a little more time for these words of comfort to take effect, but Clay eventually managed to settle on a single form. The archaeologist bit his lip… but said nothing.</p>
<p class=vs>Sensing that the storm had finally passed, the child timidly lowered their gaze to check whose identity they were now borrowing; and upon recognising it, they winced in embarrassment. But as they were about to try and correct this mistake, the young professor raised his hands in protest; his face still debating between panicked dismay and calm, cold reason, he gently but resolutely gestured them to take a deep breath… and to leave things as they were now, pleasant or not.</p>
<p class=vb>Judging that there had indeed been enough chaos in this room already, they did not need much more convincing, and nodded silently; though it was quite obvious that they did not feel at ease with this appearance at all. Both young adults did their best to gloss over the fact that it was a very atypical sight to face a tall gentleman in distinguished clothes, wearing a charming top hat, and who yet was sitting cross-legged on a small wooden chair while sporting a hangdog expression.</p>
<p class=vb>This time, the couple finally got a chance to take a closer look at this form, and they finally came to the realisation that this Hershel Layton look-alike seemed… older. Claire’s hands, placed on the table in front of her empty cup, joined in a tight grip. As a small hypothesis began to form in her mind, her fingers unconsciously tensed up. It couldn’t possibly be what she was now starting to think about… or could it?</p>
<p class=vb>“Claire said that you had admitted to having… ‘seen it before’,” the archaeologist began in a slow and heavy voice. “What did you mean by this?”</p>
<p class=vb>“…It means exactly that,” Clay sighed gravely before looking away and biting their lip. “I’ve… I already knew everyone before I arrived here.”</p>
<p class=vs>The man squinted in doubt and confusion, but he decided once again to remain silent. A few pieces of the puzzle were finally about to fall, finally about to make some semblance of sense… But once again, he still found himself with far more questions than answers.</p>
<p class=vb>Everything about their behaviour led him to believe that this child was perfectly sincere, and that even if they were not, they were a poor liar anyway. And yet… Clay obviously knew them, even seemed to know a lot about them; and despite this, they allegedly had no memory regarding their own identity? Something didn’t add up.</p>
<p class=vs>It was now obvious to him that, due to his absence from the laboratory when it had all started, a considerable amount of information had eluded him. In fact, without realising it, Claire herself had hidden from him most of the clues and deductions she had gathered, since Clay was aware of the context, and he was the only one still out of the loop. Perhaps she had expected that he would catch up without her help; simply by following the conversation, deducing the subtext, and drawing his own conclusions.</p>
<p class=vb>Perhaps she had even initially considered this as a puzzle, which she would have submitted to him as a game, in order to see how long it would take him to put the pieces back together? Well; of course, if there had ever been a game, then it was only because she had been far from predicting that their afternoon was going to take such a turn.</p>
<p class=vb>That being said, fortunately for him, the entity had finally agreed to confess, and now did not seem about to go quiet before a long while; which convinced him to opt for patience and observation, while he would simply hold a net and wait for the clues to come by themselves.</p>
<p class=vb>The impostor’s eyes, thin and black as a pair of small obsidian marbles, were once again lost and unfocused; but their mind was working actively, carefully weighting their words, and their arms once again tightened around the black pouch, always so opaque and mysterious. Then, after inhaling sharply, and releasing an equally loud and deep sigh… They looked up at them with a conflicted and pained expression.</p>
<p class=vb>“Claire, do you…” Stopping mid-sentence, they once again bit their lip tensely and decided to rephrase their entire question. “If I were to say that I… that I wasn’t supposed to be here. That if things had gone the way I know them, I…” Another pause. They gulped. “…If I hadn’t shown up and interrupted your experiment. What do you think would have happened?”</p>
<p class=vb>A great silence befell the room. Claire’s eyes widened. She did not respond, she did not move; but if one were to look at her with enough care, it would have been possible to see that she had begun to subtly shake her head from right to left, slowly and with such a weak amplitude that it was almost imperceptible, as some form of denial began to grow on her paling face.</p>
<p class=vb>“Dimitri made it quite clear, I think. And… He was right. If you had gone through with the experiment as Bill had planned it… You wouldn’t have made it out alive.”</p>
<p class=vb>Hershel Layton was at a loss for words. Claire had never told him what the experiment was supposed to be about, and never had he expected it to be this dangerous. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, sternly pushing aside the horrendous scenarios that his mind was now starting to imagine, pushing aside these fictive sights of a world without her.</p>
<p class=vb>“How could you possibly know what would have happened, since it didn’t? What you just described is… purely hypothetical.”</p>
<p class=vb>Was it reason, or fear and denial, that had driven him to refute their words? He refused to think about it; but the lack of conviction in his words already said all.</p>
<p class=vs>The physicist shivered violently; glared at them with a pair of terrified eyes, piercing those of this stranger who knew far too much. They looked back with a pained expression which was certainly much less confident and accusatory, but their look was nevertheless the same, and very well aware of the gravity of the situation. This awareness… was it even possible for a young child?</p>
<p class=vb>Not a word had been exchanged between the two; but everyone had now understood that the young woman had relented, pursued her suspicions, followed the web of her deductions, and finally validated the conclusion that she would have so much preferred being able to refute.</p>
<p class=vb>“You… travelled through time? Until <i>now</i>?” She leapt out of a chair that nearly fell to the floor, her face losing what little colour it normally had. “And you <i>changed</i> your own past!?”</p>
<p class=vb>“Not on purpose! I don’t even know how I got here!” they instantly retorted with sincere panic.</p>
<p class=vs>Time travel. Curiously, somehow, it appears that spending almost an hour in the presence of a strange shape-shifting creature, already shown to break the laws of both physics and propriety, will give you the capability of accepting just about any sort of fantasy as a believable theory.</p>
<p class=vb>Well, to be completely honest and fair, Hershel knew the basics of what his girlfriend was working on; and therefore, the idea that a time traveller could appear out of nowhere, without warning, within a laboratory whose topic of research just so happened to be, <i>coincidentally</i>, time travel as well, suddenly became a lot less far-fetched.</p>
<p class=vb>“But, well, now that it’s <i>already done</i>…” Clay muttered as they scratched the back of they neck with distinct embarrassment. “It’s a bit late to change it back, I’d say. It’s not like we could restart the experiment and pretend that, uh… We’re not going to do that, right?”</p>
<p class=vb>Claire was shaking all over, the truth having apparently just hit her for the second time, now with its true weight and with the subtlety of an anvil.</p>
<p class=vb>“I should have <i>died</i> back then…!?”</p>
<p class=vb>“P-please don’t say ‘should’,” a pale Hershel begged in a hollow, barely audible voice, now feeling light-headed and on the verge of fainting.</p>
<p class=vb>The accidental time traveller, their embarrassed pout now filled with a guilt that was once again typical of a young and immature child, looked to their right; to their left; to the floor. They pursed their lips even more, accentuating the incongruity of seeing a man who seemed beyond his thirties act with such puerility.</p>
<p class=vb>“W-well, uh, let’s look on the bright side: the universe hasn’t exploded yet, and I haven’t started blinking out of reality or anything of the sort. So… it’s all good. Right?”</p>
<p class=vb>Claire came back to sitting down, but it was far more out of necessity than out of politeness. Resting her elbows on the table, her empty teacup in the centre, she let her head fall into her hands.</p>
<p class=vb>“Clay, this is… I have no words,” she whispered in a shaky voice. “Surely, research on time travel will have progressed a little more in your original time, but here… As we saw earlier, Dimitri found a mistake in our blueprints, so there is still a lot of work to be done. And with such a mistake… I have no idea what could be possible.”</p>
<p class=vb>Not knowing what to do, and feeling rather unqualified to debate on such complex notions of polydimensional physics, the archaeologist absent-mindedly seized the teapot and refilled all cups that needed it, starting with his sweetheart’s. Claire grabbed it immediately, took a long sip, then squeezed the porcelain between both hands with a grip so tight, Clay almost expected to see cracks appear on its surface.</p>
<p class=vb>“For all we know, your current condition, your shape-shifting—Many things could have gone wrong during this time travel—Perhaps even some kind of molecular instability could be the cause? No, that wouldn’t make sense, there must be something else… We need to research this in more detail before jumping to conclusions. But for now, it could be explained by anything—by your meddling with time, or by you being present in your own past, or just because the time machine that sent you here was incomplete as well…”</p>
<p class=vb>“It’s… I-I’m sure it’s not <i>that</i> bad, really…”</p>
<p class=vs>Their attempts to reassure her were as unconvincing as they were unconvinced, and their gaze had wandered further to the walls, to the ceiling, to the small clay figurine that now seemed to be laughing at them, backed up by the mocking rattling of its dear friend the clock. As they had spoken, and again after falling silent, their thumb was once again nervously tapping the surface of their small rectangular pouch, thinking that the presence of this object had to be proof that Claire was worrying about problems that, perhaps, did not exist after all.</p>
<p class=vb>Clay soon stopped arguing, however, when they looked up and squinted at their forehead, noticing that Hershel Layton’s short brown hair had started curling and turning orange, and that a nice tuft of ginger hair fell to the side of their face. Resuming their childish and embarrassed pout, losing their forced smile, they clicked their tongue and found themselves obligated to mutter that <i>alright, maybe it is that bad</i>.</p>
<p class=vb>Taking a deep breath, trying to bring back some rationality in the room in hopes of chasing away at the very least <i>some</i> of the tension that had settled and accumulated around them… Hershel brought a hand to his chin.</p>
<p class=vb>“How much time into our future did you come from?” he asked directly, not willing to beat around the bush.</p>
<p class=vs>As his only answer, Clay stared down at the black pouch, while the top hat that they had somehow materialised out of thin air multiple times came to neatly hide their face. Had he been in a mood for laughs, perhaps the archaeologist could have felt a little pang of jealousy upon seeing that the little being could wear this hat with more ease than him; but he decided to avoid thinking too hard about the possibility that, from what he had been able to observe, this fake hat could just as well be stuck to their skull in a much less figurative way than he would have preferred.</p>
<p class=vb>In any case, it was difficult to know whether the stranger remained silent because they did not know the answer to his question, or if they blatantly did not want to answer it. Undeterred, he straightened up, crossed his arms sternly, and glared at them with authority—sending a cold shiver down their spine.</p>
<p class=vb>“Clay,” he asked quickly and accusingly, “do you know Luke Triton?”</p>
<p class=vb>“H-huh? Why him?”</p>
<p class=vb>Startled by the sudden and incongruous change of attitude and topic, they jumped in surprise—and lost at least two feet in height in the process. Noticing that the table suddenly looked much higher than before, Clay blinked in confusion, looked down, and saw a charming little blue sweater, green short pants, and the small hands of a young pre-teen boy. A small, sheepish <i>“oops”</i> escaped their mouth.</p>
<p class=vs>For once, the man was completely unfazed by this new transformation; and in fact, on the contrary, he softened immediately and made no effort of hiding a satisfied and victorious smirk.</p>
<p class=vb>Luke Triton, only son of Clark and Brenda Triton, their dear college friends whom Hershel and Claire had known for more than five years. While it was difficult to estimate the number of years which separated the impostor’s previous face to that of the real archaeologist, it was much less complex to determine this number if it was a question of comparing a three-year-old toddler with a young teenager. Leaning immediately towards his girlfriend, he asked her, not without a small hint of pride:</p>
<p class=vb>“Claire, how old would you say he looks? Ten? Eleven, perhaps?”</p>
<p class=vb>“Luke takes a lot after Brenda,” she countered, shaking her head. “He still looks quite short, but… I would guess twelve, maybe even thirteen.”</p>
<p class=vb>“About ten years in our future, then. Hm.”</p>
<p class=vb>The shape-shifter seized the brim of an adolescent Luke’s cap and burrowed within it, as they had done with every hat they had had the opportunity to wear so far. They could feel their cheeks warm up in embarrassment, but… It also seemed that this small form felt far less uncomfortable than that of any adult they had impersonated. It still did not feel like the right one, but… It suited them better, they realised. Aside from the professor’s little scheme, perhaps this was another reason why they had switched to it so easily.</p>
<p class=vs>Hershel took some long seconds to ponder the weight of the consequences that would have resulted from Clay’s actions. Their age was impossible to tell, as with everything else regarding their true identity; but if one were to consider that they appeared to act rather naïvely and childishly at times; if they were young enough, then perhaps…</p>
<p class=vb>He frowned gravely, and his lips pursed hard. Lowering the volume of his voice to the point of a whisper, he asked his girlfriend:</p>
<p class=vb>“A lot of things could have occurred in ten years. As for why they cannot remember their own identity… Could it be possible that somehow, with a series of events that had accumulated over many years… Could it be possible that by changing their past, they also prevented their own birth?”</p>
<p class=vb>“That wouldn’t explain why they can still remember events that should have been erased as well,” she argued, shaking her head subtly. “However… I’m just as lost as you are, and I have no idea what could have resulted from a change in History of this magnitude. This sounds ludicrous, and it’s far too early to conclude, but… This isn’t beyond the realm of possibility.”</p>
<p class=vs>By all means, her years of research had been spent on all sorts of theories around time travel; but neither she nor her colleagues had devoted much time and energy to the possibility of changing History and causing paradoxes. All three had always thought that the simplest and most natural way to think about the problem was the harsh truth: the truth that, although very pessimistic, especially for scientists who had had the audacity to create a machine with the very purpose of travelling through time… no one could change the past.</p>
<p class=vb>Claire repeated again and again in her mind the principle of <i>self-consistency</i>, which stated that time paradoxes were quite simply impossible to create, and that the only possible types of time travel were those that did not break the logical flow of events in any way; those which, at best, brought no change to the course of events, and which, at worst, ended up becoming their own cause of existence; those at the origin of self-fulfilling prophecies, in short. This vision seemed quite daunting, if one were to wonder about the question of free will; but until this precise moment, it was the only one in agreement with their state of the art, and their theoretical model.</p>
<p class=vb>However, research was a discipline littered with failures, challenges, and debunked theories; who was she to deny what she had right in front of her, and cloister herself in a vision that had become incomplete and possibly obsolete? This strange, amnesiac and faceless time traveller proved that this aspect that they had previously dismissed, now deserved to be studied more seriously. It was still far too early to formulate any conclusion, and Claire preferred to remain cautious; but the fact was that this child knew a version of events that would have been their own distant future, but that this version could no longer be accomplished for the one and only reason that they were present in their time, their own past; and by the fact that… that she was still alive, simply put.</p>
<p class=vs>If Clay had indeed fallen victim to a classic grandfather paradox… then perhaps the universe’s response to the fact that they had accidentally erased their own existence by their own hand, had not been to simply make them disappear completely—since it was precisely this act that would have created the time paradox. Perhaps the universe’s response was not to delete the problematic element in its entirety, since its presence remained absolutely necessary for this unusual situation to occur… But perhaps its response was rather to erase any trace of information related to them: their identity, their form, their memories; until in the end, all that was left would be some lost and unstable element, but whose existence was nevertheless necessary in order to preserve the balance of History and the integrity of space-time…</p>
<p class=vb>Such a fantasy was far too crazy to consider on its own, and the physicist was far from convinced that this scenario she had just imagined could possibly be the entire truth; but, once again, when she had Clay right in front of her… It was still worth keeping this hypothesis in mind, as improbable and delusional as it seemed.</p>
<p class=vb>“Evidently, you already knew that the experiment sh… would have gone awry,” Hershel mused, this time addressing the time traveller. “If you think back to everything that happened during those ten years that you knew… What changes could have been made in the long term, now that you stopped it? Do you have any idea about the consequences… which would affect us on a larger scale?”</p>
<p class=vb>Clay, again, pouted with puerility, guilt, and embarrassment; but this time, they had the courage to look the archaeologist in the face. The portrait of the young adolescent in short pants brought both hands to their mouth, just under their little round nose, and joined them in a concerned, deeply thoughtful gesture, letting their elbows rest on their knees, sandwiching the black pouch between their arms and their lap. They took a deep, tense, apprehensive breath; then, their hands still joined, they lowered them in their direction, ready to release their answer.</p>
<p class=vb>“Okay, to give you the entire truth… Even though all I did was end up there, and even though I didn’t do anything myself… I more or less accidentally saved Claire. But… that’s not the whole of it.”</p>
<p class=vb>Both adults, without a word, gave them the same sharp, synchronised nod; after all, they had only paraphrased what the young professor had just said, and had therefore done nothing but answer his question in the affirmative, without giving any additional information. Sensing that they were expecting more, Clay took several long seconds to breathe deeply… then continued in one go:</p>
<p class=vb>“…So, since the time machine didn’t explode, then the nearby buildings didn’t explode either, which means that we shouldn’t have to worry about a vengeful orphan boy creating an entire futuristic London replica and eventually trying to destroy the real London in order to prove a point against corruption or something, and Dimitri also won’t join him in his evil plan because since Claire’s alive he has no reason to want to go back in time to save her… Oh, and I guess I also probably interfered with politics in some way, because I may or may not have stopped Bill from becoming Prime Minister too…?”</p>
<p class=vb>As if all this were not enough already, the time traveller felt the need to elaborate by sharing their personal feelings:</p>
<p class=vb>“Well, not that I’m complaining, all of these changes are by far great improvements. Probably. I’m not completely sure about the politics thing, I don’t know if Bill was doing a good job or if his competitors would’ve done better. But as for everything else, for sure, it’s much better as it is now. I literally didn’t do anything by myself, it wasn’t on purpose, but…” They looked away again, pouted again… then their gaze snapped back up at them, sparkling in embarrassment and indecision, and they shrugged with a wide forced smile, throwing both hands in the air for emphasis. “…You’re welcome?”</p>
<p class=vb>Claire, her lips round and open, was in the perfect position for eating flies. Hershel was less than an inch away from allowing gravity and his wobbly chair to make him fall over, finishing the job that his distracted heart had started earlier, since it seemed to have forgotten to irrigate his face for at least two entire minutes.</p>
<p class=vs>If there had been any doubt as to their age until now, it had now completely evaporated; for it had to be a child for them to be able to talk about such things so lightly, without realising the horrible gravity of their words. The child, therefore, sported once again their guilty pout and, for the umpteenth time, looked at the ground sadly. Caressing the surface of the black pouch which sat on their lap and now seemed much larger due to their current appearance, they sighed deeply. Was there any way to appease them?</p>
<p class=vb>When at the very least two full minutes had passed, they couldn’t take it anymore and spoke again, collapsing under the pressure of this unbearable silence.</p>
<p class=vb>“…Anyway, by this point… It’s too late to go back, right? So, uh, while we’re at it…”</p>
<p class=vs>Both adults shared a look that was at first confused, but quickly turned concerned, then gradually terrified. A small idea as to what the child was scheming had traversed their minds, but they preferred clinging to the meagre hope that they could possibly, by some miracle, listen to the voice of reason and reconsider.</p>
<p class=vb>Unfortunately for the couple’s sanity, after about three seconds and a half of active thinking, Clay suddenly raised a round head in a blue cap… And now was shining on their face a devilish grin which, thankfully not literally, sliced their face in half. Their eyes brightly lit with childish wonder and mischief, they announced proudly:</p>
<p class=vb>“I say we do it again.”</p>
