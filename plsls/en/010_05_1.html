<p class=vs>Claire gently but firmly pushed her boyfriend towards his bed, then shut the door behind them.</p>
<p class=vb>She was done. Absolutely and utterly <i>done</i>.</p>
<p class=vb>If only she had known to be present earlier, she could have put a stop to all this before their conversation took such a turn.</p>
<p class=vb>She had worried about the state of the entire universe, about the stability of the space-time continuum, about the conservation of History; but where had gone the worries she should have kept for the love of her life? Perhaps she should have stopped him before he called his parents, insisted right from this moment that he tell her what had shaken him so. Perhaps she should have refused to let him go until he had recovered, even if it meant antagonising him for a minute or two. Perhaps, even, she should have never left the living room to begin with, and instead ensured that this little time traveller would not carry on worsening the situation more than they already had. Perhaps she should have…</p>
<p class=vb>It was such a painful, yet such an easy thing to do, to place the blame on herself. How could she have predicted that such a thing was about to take place? Rationally speaking, it would have been impossible, since she had been unaware that such an upsetting topic existed at all, and that up to this very moment, she still had no idea what they could have possibly talked about.</p>
<p class=vb>If she had to choose only one thing that she did know, however… It had to be the true meaning behind these few words that Clay had uttered.</p>
<p class=vb><i>Randall is alive.</i></p>
<p class=vb>Did she know who Randall was? Maybe. She did not know much since, as always, her boyfriend had been so secretive about it, insistently keeping all his demons inside the deepest corners of his heart, and only sharing with her tiny bits and pieces, under far too rare circumstances. Still, thanks to the power of observation and deduction… she knew enough.</p>
<p class=vb>She had never met him. She had never seen his face, never heard his voice. But she knew far too well how much the young <i>Randall Ascot</i>, who had been presumed dead for the past decade, had impacted his life.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vb>In fact, it had been just about a week or two since she had learned the truth.</p>
<p class=vb>When she had learned that her boyfriend had been granted his new position as a university professor, she had naturally been led to ask a question that she had, until then, never truly thought about:</p>
<p class=vb><i>“In the end, what made you want to study archaeology?”</i></p>
<p class=vb>This had been an innocent and genuine question. She had expected a simple and superficial answer, filled with a passion that would be all at the same time deep and sincere, yet also silly and candid. She had expected an answer and a passion that would be just as simplistic as the one she would give herself, whenever she was asked why she became a physicist.</p>
<p class=vs>Perhaps he would simply say that he found fossils, statuettes and other artifacts, whether the ones formed by nature or by a human hand, to be quite the pleasing gift to the eye; which would justify the fact that he would constantly let them pile up wherever he went like random trinkets, to the extent that hidden puzzles would proliferate like weed in every place he stepped foot.</p>
<p class=vs>Perhaps he would mention the strong interest he held for this or that element from the past, speak of this so specific field of science that yearned to experiment just like the others, but was not granted this chance in the traditional sense, since its goal was to experiment on items or climates that no longer existed.</p>
<p class=vb>Perhaps he would talk, more philosophically, about the importance of learning and remembering the life lessons left by History, passed down to them by the previous generations in hopes that the present would do better.</p>
<p class=vb>She had been ready to hear a number of different responses; but never would she have been able to predict the one he eventually gave her.</p>
<p class=vb>In great contrast to the levity of her tone, this question had taken him by surprise; made him lose both his smile and words; led him to whisper that he would rather answer it… under different circumstances. This question had been casually asked right before the bulletin board in the main hall of Gressenheller, after all; a far too public place, bustling with students and teachers alike.</p>
<p class=vb>By ‘other circumstances’, he had meant the evening of the same day, in this very place; in the silence and intimacy of his bedroom.</p>
<p class=vs>On that day, she had first heard the name of a person she thought she was destined to never meet; the name of a high school boy with a bright mind, a flamboyant personality, and ambitions far exceeding his sense of self-preservation.</p>
<p class=vb>Randall had been a young man full of aspirations, overly confident in the idea that his best friend, the quiet Hershel who always stayed in his shadow, would share this same dream; that, despite what this friend would constantly tell him at the time, they would one day become archaeologists together.</p>
<p class=vb>She had been told that these two teenagers, blinded by the folly of the inexperimented youth, had ventured into ruins of an old civilisation that they should never have underestimated; that, at the end of the day… only one had come out.</p>
<p class=vb>She had been told that the one who had come out, lost and crushed by guilt… had decided to follow his best friend’s last wish. That, no, really, he did not mind, it wasn’t like he had any true idea at the time as to what else he could have wanted to do anyway. If anything, it spared him the trouble to ponder it, and with time, he <i>had</i> learned to appreciate archaeology. Of course, the fact that he had met so many new, wonderful people on the way, made it all the more worthwhile; so really, she needed not worry, he had no regrets at all about what he chose for his own life.</p>
<p class=vb>What would he have done if this hadn’t occurred? What a foolish question. There was no point in dwelling on the past, in losing oneself in suppositions and baseless hypotheses, when nobody, not even himself, would be able to tell. This question would be forever irrelevant, since there was no way that he was…</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vb><i>Randall is alive.</i></p>
<p class=vb>When Claire had heard this sentence, she had needed four and two tenths of a second before she could understand who it was referring to. This had been decently fast, given her lack of context… yet, still far too slow for her to truly react in time.</p>
<p class=vb>To say that these words had utterly annihilated him would have been an understatement.</p>
<p class=vb>It could seem paradoxical to see him take such news, which should have normally been a mesmerising miracle, with a face distorted by fear and sheer horror. In all honesty, if only because she was in this moment in the heat of the action and unwilling to busy her mind with too many thoughts, Claire herself had yet to discern the more intricate reasons that could explain the extent of his reaction; but the reasons troubled her far less than the result.</p>
<p class=vs>Not taking so much as the time to think, she had stepped in between them, sending her boyfriend a pair of eyes filled with confusion and distress… but radiating an intransigent resolve; the resolve of someone who had failed her duty once, and would never forgive herself if she were to make the same mistake again.</p>
<p class=vb>When she had seen his face, she had faltered for an instant; but, knowing full well what she needed <i>not</i> to do, she had recovered her severity just as fast.</p>
<p class=vb>She had claimed that it needed to stop; that it should have stopped much sooner already.</p>
<p class=vb>She had seized both of her dear boyfriend’s hands, hugging them tight within hers; had told him, with tenderness and authority, that <i>they had to talk</i>.</p>
<p class=vb>Hardly turning back to Clay, she had ordered them to wait in the living room, and had not attempted to think about what they would be doing in the meantime. Whatever it was that they would busy themselves with, at least nobody would be present to hear words they would all regret.</p>
<p class=vb>The sheepish child had nodded wordlessly, letting their legs dangle nervously and guiltily between the chair and the floor, too ashamed to watch them leave the room.</p>
<p class=vb>While being ushered into his room, the young professor’s new top hat had started slipping off his head; she had simply caught it in one arm as it fell, and kept it to her chest, as she carried on resolutely pushing him away from the one who had caused all of his turmoil.</p>
<p class=vb>Claire thus slammed the door shut behind her, leaned her back against it, tightly hugged the hat as if it could in any shape or form help her stand upright despite her exhaustion… and stared at the man who now stood in front of her, lost in his thoughts. She inhaled deeply, then came to join him.</p>
<p class=vb>And now that they were both in his room, sitting on his bed side by side in silence… She suddenly found herself just as distraught as he was, and devoid of helpful initiatives.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vb>He was barely conscious that he had changed setting, and was now sitting on his bed. He had found himself in this quite strange state of mind in which he was aware of his surroundings, yes; and yet, not quite aware of what was truly unfolding around him.</p>
<p class=vb>It is this same state of mind in which you believe you have opinions; in which you think you wanted to confront Claire, tell her that you knew perfectly what you were doing, tell her that she needed not patronise you; yet in which you said nothing and let her shove you around and into your own bedroom, because the hurricane swirling in your mind, blowing away the broken pieces of your thoughts and memories, was too thick and loud to let you react to what was occurring outside of your head.</p>
<p class=vb>It is the same state of mind as these times when you walk into a room looking for something, only to pause at the entrance and find yourself still and confused, as you realise that you forgot what this ‘something’ was; as you realise that, for the life of you, you can neither recall what you had come here for, nor believe how you could forget such a simple and obvious detail in such a short amount of time.</p>
<p class=vb>What had become of this rage that had consumed him? It had not waned, that much he was certain. But in spite of this… he was still incapable of knowing what himself was feeling in this moment. The grief for a loss that never occurred, the anger of treason, the despair and fear of the unknown, the… numbness, while facing the futility of it all. It was as if he could see this typhoon roaring inside his head, this fury wanting to destroy everything not even for the sake of retaliation or justice, but simply because it felt the need to express its pain in a way that words alone would never achieve…</p>
<p class=vb>Those emotions were his, or at least he reasoned that they had to be; but despite being at the heart of the massacre, it was as if he were overseeing this destruction from miles away, on top of a tower with a view over the decades of lies and tragedy he had lived, watching every piece of his life being swept away endlessly… and not feeling involved in the slightest.</p>
<p class=vb>If this was what an out-of-body experience could feel like… Once again, he could not fathom how he should even feel about it.</p>
<p class=vs>He was drowning in despair and helplessness, realising what he could have lost.</p>
<p class=vs>He was squirming with rage, reflecting on the betrayals he had faced.</p>
<p class=vs>He was cowering in fear, thinking of the consequences brought by his past choices.</p>
<p class=vb>He was standing immobile, stoic, frozen in time and numb to it all.</p>
<p class=vb>Claire, always such a bright yet soft light in the eternal darkness, was what managed to pull him back, if ever so slightly, to the reality of the warm, but ever so tense and unwanted present.</p>
<p class=vb>“We talked about the future disasters they witnessed,” she said promptly before he could have processed the idea to even ask, “but we both wanted to wait for you to come back before addressing anything related to you. Whatever it is that you discussed while I was with Dimitri, I have no idea of it,” she clarified with a stone-faced expression.</p>
<p class=vs>Slowly, he found his rationality and logic come back to him. Like a lifebuoy in the middle of the ocean, he desperately clung to it.</p>
<p class=vb>Logic was safe. Critical thinking was the key. Reason had always been the only thing one could rely on, under every circumstance.</p>
<p class=vs>He reassessed her words. He put every sound her voice had produced under cautious scrutiny.</p>
<p class=vs>In the end, the fact that she still thought Clay had lived through these events at all was what convinced him. Had the child told her the truth, she would have known better than to still refer to them as a <i>‘witness.’</i></p>
<p class=vb>He nodded in acknowledgement of her testimony. Hard evidence stated that he should believe her for this one.</p>
<p class=vb>“I will not ask you to explain it if you don’t want me to know,” she continued as softly as she could. He could hear in the undertones that her curiosity and concern were disagreeing with her words; but the restraint she showed was proof enough of her genuine intent, and of the place where laid her priorities. “What matters to me is how you feel. Hershel… I don’t know what I could ever do to help; but I want to be here for you. It’s the least I can do.”</p>
<p class=vb>“It’s the least you couldn’t have done.”</p>
<p class=vb>His sentence was followed by a short, yet glacial silence. His lips closed sharply. He started trembling, apologised weakly. A dry sob escaped him.</p>
<p class=vb>The woman froze, fiddling with her hands in remembrance. Though it would have been against her volition, he had still reminded her of the harsh truth. The truth that she shouldn’t be by his side anymore; the truth that she was supposed to be…</p>
<p class=vb>“Hershel…”</p>
<p class=vb>“I don’t even know if this is my name anymore.”</p>
<p class=vb>Claire stared at him in shock; stifled a short, humourless laugh of confusion and disbelief; but she did not inquire further.</p>
<p class=vb>“Hers—” She immediately bit her tongue. She forgot to breathe. She shook her head slowly, looking at him with lost and brimming eyes. “…What did they tell you?”</p>
<p class=vb>“Only the truth.”</p>
<p class=vs>She already knew this much. Certainly he knew of this, and knew that this was anything but a meaningful answer. Perhaps he had proceeded with these useless words anyway as a means to deliver the message that she was to remain ignorant.</p>
<p class=vb>Still… Gathering her courage, she dared ask:</p>
<p class=vb>“Do you want to talk about it?”</p>
<p class=vs>There was a deep, but soon cut short breath. The man turned his head to look at her, sadness and guilt washing over his eyes. He opened his mouth, closed it instantly, pinched his lips in a trembling grip, as a perfect echo of the one that paralysed his throat. His gaze, now filled with shame, lowered to the brown hat which now sat on her lap, between her arms.</p>
<p class=vs>Following his clues, she looked down as well, smiled weakly, and gave it back to him—not forgetting to mention that he still very much deserved it, no matter what had occurred in the past; no matter what would occur in the future.</p>
<p class=vb>This hat was his; the efforts he had given to obtain his new profession were his; and despite his actions in the past few minutes, she assured that the title of gentleman was still his as well. She was convinced of it; even if himself no longer believed so.</p>
<p class=vb>When she handed it to him, he seized it carefully, yet mechanically; and even as it was now safe within his arms, he had them coil around it even more, had his entire body bend over it, had his chin rest on its flat top. A broken, stiff and humourless snort escaped him, as he realised that, for once, its stupidly tall shape actually made it comfortable to keep in such an embrace.</p>
<p class=vs>As silence resumed and settled… Claire wondered whether he would actually decide to never share his turmoil, and instead allow it to forever grow inside of him, until the burden would expand enough to suffocate him from within.</p>
<p class=vb>She had made her inquiry because she wanted to know, sure; but the primary reason had not been for her own sake.</p>
<p class=vs>Evidently, he did not want her to know. Or at least, he was unsure of it for now, perhaps even scared of her reaction to it—something she could imagine as a futile, but perfectly reasonable fear, given the extent of his current state of mind.</p>
<p class=vs>She knew him, she knew herself, and she trusted herself to not change her love for him in the slightest, no matter what would transpire; but what truly mattered was the fact that, if only in this moment, he did not quite share this perspective.</p>
<p class=vb>And this was fine.</p>
<p class=vb>She had not asked him to tell her the truth. She had simply asked him whether he wanted a shoulder to cry on; hoping that he would at least accept this much, for his own sake.</p>
<p class=vb>She was no psychologist, and she was no gardener; she did not have the experience nor tools to rid him of this invasive weed, which was nurturing, then feeding on his sorrows and anguish. She wished it could be as easy as to simply reach out and rip it out, hoping to eradicate it down to the deepest end of its very roots; but if he was unwilling to even let her see the thorny brambles at all, how could she do so much as graze the surface?</p>
<p class=vs>Yet… Thankfully, miraculously, after an agonisingly long wait spent powerlessly listening to his pained and breathless sighs…</p>
<p class=vb>To her surprise yet great relief, he eventually replied that, perhaps… Perhaps he needed to.</p>
<p class=vb>And so he did. Slowly; reluctantly, and with great restraint; with words that were at first simple, few and far between… but which gradually managed to become a coherent narrative.</p>
<p class=vb>He said that he had been adopted; that his biological parents had been abducted by a criminal organisation, which Clay had mentioned would come back in the future, and whose crimes and power seemed far too threatening to ignore.</p>
<p class=vb>He said that his brother, because yes, he had just learned that he had an older brother, had swapped their names so that he would be adopted in his stead; and thus, that neither ‘Hershel’ nor ‘Layton’ had ever been meant to refer to him.</p>
<p class=vb>He said that his new parents, for more than twenty years, had not only hidden this truth from him, but had even had the audacity to keep in touch with said brother, and yet never let him know that he even <i>existed</i>.</p>
<p class=vb>Claire was hearing the words, imagining the scenes he described, retracing the steps he had certainly gone through himself before this point; but this entire story felt so unbelievable, so unjust, so heartbreaking, that she could not help but feel distanced from reality itself. Perhaps, since he had not truly wanted her to know anyway, it was for the best that she would merely let him speak in peace.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vs>He could no longer close his mouth. He had wished to maintain what little tact and thoughtfulness he still had, wished to not drown his sweetheart with his selfish worries… But the more he talked, the more he found himself unable to stop. Was it the confusion in his mind? The sheer weight of the knowledge he had been cursed with? The regrets, the fears…? Perhaps it was the fact that he had failed her so many times already; failing again would no longer matter.</p>
<p class=vb>In the end, after what felt like an eternity… Somehow, he seemed to discover that there actually was an end to the list of disasters that had become his life. There was no end to the suffering, no; but knowing that there was a finite number of tragedies, despite being intuitively something realistic and logical… Somehow, this felt like a surprising revelation.</p>
<p class=vb>Still… The pain was all the same.</p>
<p class=vb>“You could have died,” he muttered weakly. “My own parents lied to me for decades. I couldn’t even remember that I had other parents and a brother, and I lived my entire life without them—I lived without my <i>best friend</i> for a decade and thought him dead. Even Andrew might…”</p>
<p class=vb>He let his sentence trail off again, staring at his trembling hands which could hardly keep a hold of his newest gift, struggling and failing to keep his breathing steady. After one more instant, clutching the hat ever closer to him, he slowly shook his head in disbelief and added, with a strange mixture between a desolate sigh and desperate laughter:</p>
<p class=vb>“It feels like you are the only one who would never lie to me—who would trust me as much as I trust you. And you could have…”</p>
<p class=vb>He was too weak to utter this dreaded word for a third time. He had a thought for Clark, for Brenda, for a few others of his friends and acquaintances; but a part of him, in this single moment, felt overwhelmed by the ones who had betrayed him.</p>
<p class=vs>His thoughts were overrun by the images of his parents and brother, who had hidden such a large part of his own life from him. He had been denied the truth of his origins; denied the knowledge that there were at least three people related to him by blood, somewhere out there; denied his own birth name. He had been denied the legitimate concern over the fate of his biological parents: were they still alive? Were they still captive? What did this organisation do to them?</p>
<p class=vs>All these questions, all these worries which he <i>should</i> have felt, as a son should feel for his parents; instead of pondering about them, of trying to solve such a fundamental puzzle, of trying to find their whereabouts and perhaps even save them from the claws of their abductors… He had wasted so many years, entirely oblivious to their very existence.</p>
<p class=vb>Now that he knew, he blamed himself for not having figured it out sooner; for not having given his original parents a single thought in more than two decades.</p>
<p class=vb>Would worrying for them have done any good? Perhaps not. But even in the eventuality that they were already dead—<i>especially</i> in the eventuality that they were dead—, it was a crime to deny him the obligation to honour their memory; or at the very least… to not <i>forget</i>.</p>
<p class=vs>His thoughts were overrun by the image of Stansbury and the friends who had chastised him for Randall’s accidental, yet ultimately nonexistent death. They had not chased him out of town with pitchforks, of course; but given the slow agony that had been the stares, the cold mutterings in his back, the nonvocal but oh so clear rejection of the people he used to call friends… They might as well have been.</p>
<p class=vb>He had been reproved by his friends and treated like a murderer; at times, he too had thought he was one. The village he grew up in had dwindled and died a slow and painful death. He had dedicated his entire studies, and now his newfound position, to honouring the memory of the friend he had seen fall into the abyss; to living the life he could no longer live, for his sake.</p>
<p class=vs>And he was not dead. Somehow, all along, Randall had remained alive somewhere out there, and they never knew.</p>
<p class=vb>All the pain, all the hatred, all the burdens… had all been for <i>nothing</i>.</p>
<p class=vb>And, once again, his thoughts were overrun by the presence of this unknown entity, or child, or adult, or whoever this was, who was the entire opposite to all these people—but who knew far too much and had been far too open about it, all the while being a complete stranger to them all. How could he know that the ones he called friends would not also hide such secrets from him eventually…?</p>
<p class=vb>These dark thoughts partially faded away when he felt a light and soft touch on his cheek. Wordlessly, he turned his head to face Claire, and let her give him another short and gentle, but so very welcome kiss. She slowly embraced him; delicately and shakingly putting his hat aside, he returned the gesture, his grip tight and desperate as if she could vanish at any moment.</p>
<p class='hr bar'>⁂</p><p class=hourglass>⁂</p>
<p class=vb>Claire felt his strong embrace crushing her with his fears, and tried her best to respond to his fearful thorns with her soothing gentleness; to remind him of her presence; to remind him of her love.</p>
<p class=vs>He was a measly twenty-seven years old, and he had already lost so much. Worse still… He had become so good at hiding it from everyone; himself included.</p>
<p class=vb>She was glad that he had at least been able to remember this much: that he could trust her; that she would always trust him. That this mutual bond they had spent so many years building, still meant the world to her.</p>
<p class=vs>She felt a sickening knot in her stomach.</p>
<p class=vs>After more than five years, not so long ago, she had finally been able to get through to him, to get him to open up about his past wounds; and just a few days later, had the circumstances been different, she would have… She would have disappeared from his life; and with it, all their countless efforts would have been in vain.</p>
<p class=vs>Part of her had yet to fully realise that she could have died; that in this very moment, she <i>should be dead</i>. And yet, even without having grasped the reality that her life could have ended, this part of her heart had now realised what this would have meant for the man she cherished so much.</p>
<p class=vb>She had slowly but surely succeeded in getting closer to him, until he would finally begin to share with her his darkest secrets, until finally he would have found a shoulder to cry on, and to cradle in return. She had told him that everything was going to be alright, that they would always have each other… only to abandon him at such a crucial moment?</p>
<p class=vb>In some twisted sense… Even she, in her death, would have betrayed his trust. Were she not already happy to be alive for the fact of living on its own, she now definitely was all the happier to be alive for him.</p>
<p class=vb>“I’m here…” This was the only thing she found herself able to say, in the softest of whispers. “I’m here.”</p>
<p class=vb>These words were simple and obvious, and she knew it; but they were the only coherent ones she could muster. To make it worse still, only at the last moment had she remembered to not utter a certain one in particular. Perhaps she should have… Perhaps she had made the right choice by avoiding it. Either way, she had reasoned that using it in this moment would have only hurt him again.</p>
<p class=vb>“Claire, I’m…” His breathing was too irregular to let him finish; assuming he even knew how to finish his sentence to begin with, that was. Defeated, he sighed in despair. “I don’t know what to do. There are so many things that I must do—so many things I should’ve done…”</p>
<p class=vb>She shook her head, incapable of putting words to her thoughts.</p>
<p class=vb>He was questioning his own name, despite his obvious, fond and sincere attachment to the life he had lived so far. The more she saw and heard him, the more she felt convinced that this questioning came not from his own wishes, but from external factors—from what had gone missing from his life, and what he likely could never truly find again.</p>
<p class=vb>He had admitted that he had picked up on archaeology solely in remembrance of his (not-so) deceased friend, and he had remained committed to it for an entire decade afterwards; without ever expressing signs of having second thoughts about it, up until this accursed confrontation with his fate.</p>
<p class=vb>And now, if this form that Clay had taken multiple times truly reflected what he would have looked like originally, ten years in their future, ten years after her death, and yet still wearing this stupid hat after all this time…</p>
<p class=vs>A pattern was being drawn. Needless to say, she did not like it.</p>
<p class=vs>Every muscle in her face tensed at once. She was unsure whether she was going to make things better or worse; but Claire Foley would never be caught dead—</p>
<p class=vb>…Well. Rather, she would never find herself in a situation of despair, and just stand by watching.</p>
<p class=vb>“Would you rather change back to your birth name?”</p>
<p class=vb>He froze.</p>
<p class=vb>“No.” His face was just as uncertain and lost as before, but the resolve in his voice had sounded decisive.</p>
<p class=vb>Claire gave him a soft and encouraging smile. “Then this settles that issue, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p class=vb>He sighed heavily, looking away. “I… I suppose.”</p>
<p class=vb>He could not imagine himself being called any different. Some disjointed memories of his childhood were now vivid in his mind; but being called ‘Theodore’… He simply could not bring himself to thinking that this truly ever had been his name. So the reason that still made him hesitate… was it culpability? Regret? Did he even… <i>want</i> to reconnect with his birth family? If he had left when he was but a three-year-old toddler, they all might as well have been complete strangers. But even so, to completely break such a strong, sacred bond…</p>
<p class=vb>“If <i>you</i> don’t want to change it, then nobody has the right to take that away from you.”</p>
<p class=vb>In a way only she knew how, his sweetheart seemed to have acquired the ability to read his mind.</p>
<p class=vb>“If you meet your family again,” she continued, “I am certain that they will much rather see a grown, accomplished, wonderful man, than a child they haven’t seen in decades.” He did not know that for sure, but… He certainly hoped so. “And if they prove to be the contrary, they’ll have to answer to me. They won’t know what they’re missing.”</p>
<p class=vb>She showed him a fist. The thought of Claire punching strangers in the face was laughable, as this would have been far too uncouth of a lady such as herself, and he knew that she was merely saying it for dramatic effect. Still, her ridiculous proposition succeeded in stealing from him a short and repressed, but so very welcome breath hiding the tiniest sparks of laughter. It had been brief and more bittersweet than genuine; but it was a start.</p>
<p class=vb>Claire bent down and to the side, her face breaking into his field of vision.</p>
<p class=vb>“So I ask again: does this cement how you feel about yourself?”</p>
<p class=vs>He took a deep breath, then a few excruciatingly long seconds to ponder. The weight of his duty as a family member still remained, and would surely not go away until he would be able to hear these same words from the ones who had given him the name he wanted to forget; but perhaps, indeed, if they could not accept this… The Laytons would be the only parents worth having.</p>
<p class=vb>In the end, he found his conclusion:</p>
<p class=vb>“…Yes. It does.” A thin, trembling smile struggled to distort his lips upwards. “I… Thank you, Claire. Thank you.”</p>
<p class=vb>She cupped his chin, gently turned it in her direction. Then she wrapped her hands around his cheeks and looked at him fondly.</p>
<p class=vs>“I know a man. His name is Hershel Layton, and my life has been mesmerising ever since I had the miraculous chance to meet him.</p>
<p class=vb>“I fell in love with him, and never regretted it. He is soft, gentle, so kind and compassionate… always here for others, to a fault even. He will always think of anyone else, friend or stranger alike… before he will stop to think that, sometimes, he too needs caring and assistance. Perhaps, this might be the only thing I could reproach him.”</p>
<p class=vb>She embraced him again, hugging him as tightly as her strength could. For just a second, before she slightly released her grasp, she had become the reason he was struggling to breathe, instead of the crippling anguish in his throat.</p>
<p class=vb>“This man, I tell you…” she laughed in what sounded like some strange loving exasperation. “He cares so much about other people, and he wants to bear so many burdens he should not ever have to carry, that… Far too often, he forgets that he is allowed to live for himself, too.”</p>
<p class=vb>Letting go, she stood to face him, caressed his cheek once more, and planted a playful kiss. Her eyes were shining; he could not tell whether she had tears, or if they were a reflection of something else. There… certainly was something welling up in his eyes.</p>
<p class=vb>“You are Hershel Layton, and I love you.”</p>
<p class=vb>There was a soft, wonderful and patient smile. There was a refreshing, liberating breeze of silence. A silence hiding the distant echo of decades old shackles finally breaking and falling back into the abyss they had emerged from; a silence of freedom.</p>
<p class=vb>Hershel Layton heard these words, and wept.</p>
