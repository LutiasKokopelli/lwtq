    <nar>Sans would tell Dawn about his past self's message when he explains in Act III how his memory works and why he forgot everything after the machine exploded?<br>Dawn: "And the reason you didn't tell me right away is because... you didn't trust me yet with how your memory works, right?" "Hey, no problem. I get it."</nar>
    <nar>What if there was a series of caves below the Snowdin Falls?<br>In all towns: food creation/harvest + police/Royal Guard training<br>Most of the transfer of electricity throughout the Underground is done through the ceiling.<br>Ruins; Home; Snowdin; Waterfall; Waterfall-Capital Marsh; Hotland; CORE; New Home<br>The CORE is next to Hotland and below the Capital.<br>Waterfall is about 1,53 times larger than Snowdin.</nar>
    <nar>Dawn paled. "Y-you've been listening to us? [when they were discussing with Papyrus & Alphys about the videogame]"<br>Flowey stuck his tongue out and winked playfully. "Aww, don't tell me you didn't expect me to."<br>"You know, it's funny how everybody seems to forget about me. It's true, I'm always standing in the sidelines, watching from the shadows until the very end... But still! It's frustrating to feel like nobody cares about me. You'd be surprised, but you don't need a soul to feel left behind."</nar>
    <nar>When in the Ruins, Sans keeps the random monsters at bay so no random encounters are triggered. See how it goes for Flowey and Napstablook though...</nar>
    <dlg>Steven: "Not gonna lie, I would've been very surprised if my game suddenly started showing me dialogue boxes of what you're saying, stuff like that. Besides, your world is slightly different to the game's, right? If anything had gone even slightly off-script because of a small inconsistency between the game script and how your world works, at least <i>someone</i> would've noticed by now. It didn't take long for <i>Dawn</i>, who isn't even into all that datamining stuff. So... yeah."</dlg>
    <dlg>Sans: "<sans>so we're really... i just don't get it. on our side we're plagued with all this weird game stuff, but on your end there's no benefit at all? not even a small difference? i just... what's even the point of keepin us linked to the game, if it works exactly the same with or without us?</sans>"</dlg>
    <dlg>Steven: "Beats me... But that just confirms we can fix this mess without any regret."</dlg>
    <nar>During III², excerpts from Lys/Steven/others' perspective as they are crafting a plan.<br>- Steven tries to locate and decipher the reason behind the entanglement set on Steam's version of Undertale.<br>- Lys manages to get numerical copies of monster science books & Sans's plans of his multiple machines, both time-based and parallel world travel. At the end of act III², Lys checks on her father and notices that he has been drawing blueprints... and they looked almost complete.</nar>
    <nar>The plan is that at the most opportune time, Lys would try to lure Sans and Dawn in his basement, then snatch them both (or at least Dawn, and Sans if they can) out through Lys's portal and immediately shut it down: both saving Dawn and presumably stopping AD from being able to use Sans upon Resetting. (Sadly, that second part wouldn't work because if AD were to reset then a memory-less Sans copy would just appear out of nowhere, and then be used even more easily by AD to continue the cycle.)<br>Otherwise, since Sans probably wouldn't make it safely in Dawn's world, the plan is that since they managed to entangle Lys's portal machine to Sans's time machine, every time AD would try to Reset and restart the cycle, Lys would be able to catch up and stop Sans + send him all his memories back each time. That way, even if AD keeps resetting, no attempt would presumably work, until AD would hopefully give up.</nar>
    <nar>During IV, AD gets tired of Sans and decides to have at least one longer timeline where he gets killed off at the start and he gets to watch the others develop without him. (Coincidentally, Steam gets a power outage for a few days because of Steven's antics?? Justifying why nobody would reset during that time???)</nar>
    <nar>When Dawn falls unconscious after sprinting for so long, Undyne catches up to her but, worried that what she said about Papyrus being in danger would be true, she calls out to both the nearest monster around so they would keep watch, and calls the Canine Unit on the phone so they come asap and bring Dawn to custody. Undyne insists on not harming her because she needs to be interrogated. She keeps running towards Snowdin Town at the same time, until she finds Papyrus... getting gobbled up alongside a human child inside a magic black cube.<br>At first Dawn is under the Snowdin custody, but when Undyne checks out her stuff and gets more and more déjà-vu, she soon changes her mind and states that she'll bring her back to her home in order to interrogate her personally (???).</nar>
    <nar>CHAPTER 003: AD is noticeably absent from the narration during the entirety of the chapter.</nar>
    <nar>> Alphys trying to fix the CORE. She insists on how reckless Sans's plan was and whether he cared at all that there was a real risk that the entirety of Hotland, if not the whole Underground itself, would blow up; and she reminisces how the past month went. Flashbacks possibly.</nar>
    <nar>> Asgore checking on the human souls and interacting with Dunra Zither, and perhaps some members of the aristocracy, like Muffet's parents.</nar>
    <nar>> Dawn, alone in Snowdin, is done cleaning up the house and gets bored. Curious about seeing what Waterfall looks like, she borrows Sans's jacket and walks a bit, being mindful to remember where the cameras are. She soon comes back when she realizes that the path is much bigger than she thought.</nar>
    <nar>CHAPTER 004: Original 004: Sans meets Asgore, then Alphys.</nar>
    <nar>CHAPTER 005: Original 005 + Sans</nar>
    <nar>After the first day (probably after the end of Act II), Sans (and perhaps Dawn?) get the idea to write a message to Toriel. It's written numerically and Sans would print it every morning to send it to Toriel through a shortcut every morning after it.</nar>
    <boxgame><sans>
        <nar>if you can, please take this message seriously. it will probably be hard to believe and you might think it's a joke, but it's really important.</nar>
        <nar>a human child will fall down today, and if you follow your usual routine, you'll find them soon. problem is, that human isn't like the others. if you're reading this message, it means that this human is a huge threat to everybody.</nar>
        <nar>i'm not saying this because i hate humans or anything like that. i'm saying this because, it's hard to believe, but i'm a time traveler and i've already seen this day happen many times by now. i know how it's gonna go. and if i trust what you've told me in some past loops, you'll find that human very familiar when you see them, even if you probably won't remember why.</nar>
        <nar>i'm saying this human is dangerous because you can't know what they'll do, but whatever they do nobody here will like it. that kid might not kill everyone on sight, but they can and WILL kill it if that's what they want to do. there's no way to tell what they'll choose to do before it happens, so our best bet is to let them alone.</nar>
        <nar>don't try talking to them. they won't respond and they won't stop. in fact, i don't even think they CAN hear you.<br>don't try to stop them either. there's nothing you can do. if you want to keep everyone safe, that human kid included, then spread the message that nobody should go anywhere near them. if you leave them alone then they hopefully won't go after you.</nar>
        <nar>ps: you already know me as that guy you've been sharing knock-knock jokes with. i know all that stuff because i've been living through it many times, so please believe me. my real name is sans by the way, in case you can't remember it.</nar>
        <nar>pps: feel free to walk out of the ruins if everybody is safe. no other human will show up in the ruins anytime soon, so if you want answers or just a chat, you can come with. if you're looking for me, just ask the locals for directions to snowdin town.</nar>
    </sans></boxgame>
    <nar>Before chapter 51, Yoshua, Lee and some others will harass Steven and Lys about the video. Yoshua will ask Lys something like "is that why you showed us the photo and tried to have us prove it was fake? YOU WANTED US TO FIND FLAWS SO YOU WOULD PERFECT HOW THE VIDEO LOOKS?? IS THAT IT???"</nar>

    <nar>[Lys asks Sans if he has any good quantum physics books he could share with her, because she loves science and espcially quantum physics. Then she starts pestering him with physics questions, and he quickly catches on; he appears genuinely invested in the conversation too.]<br>AD: "UGH. Getting bored here! We're supposed to go to New Home right about now, remember?"<br>Dawn: "Aww, can't you see they're having fun? We can go ahead, Sans will catch up. Either that or we'll have to sit through more of their Technobabble."<br>[...]<br>Lys: "But yeah, then if black holes can only suck in stuff through gravity, then how can they suck in photons, since they have no mass? That doesn't make..." She slowly stopped in the middle of her sentence, trying to see from the corner of her screen how empty Sans's basement was. Then she uttered a sigh of relief. "Never mind. He's gone."<br>Sans had a small laugh of disbelief. "can't believe that worked."<br>Lys: "You think he might've suspected something?"<br>Sans: "don't think so..." "your acting's really good. almost scary."</nar>

    <h3>FANART FOR EACH CHAPTER:</h3><input class="ogabtn" type="button" value="Show" onclick="this.value=this.value=='Show'?'Hide':'Show';"  style="width:auto;padding-left:18px;"><div class="spoiler"><div>
    <ul class="save-point"><li>002(& old 003) - Scene 2. Or 2 artworks...? One where they discuss, one where Dawn sees the empty Snowdin</li></ul><hr>
    <nar>I don't think Sans is interested in videogames; at least nowhere near as interested as Undyne or Alphys (and Alphys doesn't actually like playing videogames, she's only into the story of the games rather than the playing part) Sans wouldn't be into playing Smash or Undertale/Deltarune. He definitely wants to av the fandom that turned him into a bunch of memes. Sans's trolling is more about what he could do so he would totally troll absolutely everyone by doing stuff that'd borderline expose his real identity but just not quite yet and he'd drive everyone crazy just for the kicks</nar>
    <nar>Alphys and Undyne would totally want him to though, like whenever they find a cool fancomic with Sans in it they'd go pester him and be chanting like "THE DUB! THE DUB! THE DUB!" And Sans would just, like, abscond from the scene. a very flat and categoric noping out</nar>
    <nar>Alphys would spend her free time online as a Youtuber who would make anime reviews and stuff. AlphysExplains would somehow become a shady but talented and knowledgeable youtuber who never shows her face but gives great anime analyses and loves Undertale/Deltarune for some reason even though otherwise she rarely ever plays any video games. I totally see Alphys being head over heels in Deltarune theories; I can see her saying something at some point like "To all the conspiracy theorists who believe that reptilian people secretly live among your society: you're technically not wrong."</nar>
    <nar>Imagine alphys qui lit les commentaires et voit un hater: "you ut headcanons are so bad like it's contradicting canon"</nar>
    <nar>"Hello friend, but frankly what makes you think that it is not the video game that made teensy mistakes here and there until it came to contradict the true canon?"</nar>
    <nar>(More seriously, she'd probably collaborate with guys like steven so that she knows better what the canon game is like)</nar>
    <nar>Undyne would probably make her own gaming channel and they'd make crossovers in their videos. Undyne is a huge fan of video games, especially ones that follow anime codes.</nar>
    <nar>Sans trolls about a lot of things, but never about the video game. That palm goes over to Alphys and Undyne. The only trolling Sans uses that has anything to do with Undertale is doing stuff to make Players deliberately uncomfortable just for the kicks of pissing them off. But as long as it goes towards actually giving fans of Undertale what they want, nah. He never really liked the attention.</nar>
    <nar>He would totally troll absolutely everyone by doing stuff that'd borderline expose his real identity but just not quite yet and he'd drive everyone crazy just for the kicks. Because they kind of want to keep Undertale a secret in Dawn's universe in order to prevent random bad political stuff or media or just getting the monsters in trouble generally speaking; but in the end it means that the Players who already know the truth are far more worried about this whole thing than Sans is. So Sans's trolling is totally about playing with their nerves because of this; kinda as revenge for them ruining his life in the past.</nar>
    <nar>ConnectiCon Meeting: Sans comes without warning and even though they're happy to see him they're extra careful about just making sure that everybody around just believes it's a guy in a cosplay.</nar>
    <dlg>"Oh hey, there's the Undertale cosplay photoshoot nearby. You guys wanna take pictures?"</dlg>
    <dlg>"Nah, c'mon, the promo for [redacted] is going to start soon. We don't have time."</dlg>
    <dlg>"Hey, did you guys see Sans?"</dlg>
    <dlg>"Oh, he must've gone a bit ahead towards the shops. He probably didn't..."</dlg>
    <dlg>"... oh my God he did."</dlg>
    <dlg>"Holy fucking shit he totally did."</dlg>
    <dlg>"SANS COME BACK HERE"</dlg>
    <nar>What if Sans wore a shittily made sans mask, too? Honestly the first cosplay idea I had, which had to be the one thing he'd go for in order to piss off the most people, would be something like SANZY FRESH just to piss everyone off. also tbh i kind of want to see Lys and Dawn and potentially others being harassed by tinfoil hats wearing people</nar>
    <nar>and I've had in mind at least one moment when someone compliments him on his costume only to realize that he's real and then everyone goes "uhhhh y'know what if sans signs you an autograph or gives you a selfie or something will you keep that a secret until at least, um, next month?"</nar>
    <nar>"ADMIT IT YOU MET ALIENS AND THESE ALIENS ARE UNDERTALE IS TOBY FOX INVOLVED TOO"</nar>
    <hr>
    <nar>"ok now i need an au in which instead of teen dawn sans kidnaps 6yo dawn"</nar>
    <nar>[Start with Sans launching his machine, then waiting for a signal... and waiting... and then boom he's woken up by an alarm: "HARD MODE PLAYER DETECTED", so he pushes lots of buttons and gets ready to open the shortcut.] [In Charlie's room, Charlie is with Lys and Steven...</nar>
    <dlg>"Look Dawn, I'm *trying* to play this game. Hugs will be later, okay?"</dlg>
    <nar>(she insists and he ends up taking her in his lap) (the portal opens) (dawn's soul turns blue) (dawn flies through the portal) (Charlie alone, still staring, with the portal gone)</nar>
    <dlg>Charlie: *INTERNAL SCREAMING* / *BSOD* / (fenêtre "Charlie.exe a planté")</dlg>
    <nar>Bonus: show Sans with Dawn in his arms, looking at the audience in "?????????" mode</nar>

    <nar>They meet someone cosplaying an UT character and because Sans was given a dare by Alphys/Undyne/Papyrus before coming, he has to take a selfie with every single UT cosplay he sees. Sans comes to meet the Sans cosplayer and tells him bluntly "hey nice cosplay can i take a selfie it's cause of a dare and all that" so they start talking and all. And then the cosplayer goes and asks for sans's name or something. i think i thought at some point that sans wanted to joke about how he wanted to rally a sans army or something because part of his dare was also to count every single sans cosplay because they had been placing bets as to how many they would meet. anyway i think he'd go like "oh yeah just call me sans" and the cosplayer guy says "haha fair but seriously we can't call you all sans so what's ur real name"<br>"Ness?

    <h1>[Hacking]</h1><p>UNDERTALE - Debug Mode, Room Codes, and FUN: Editing files in Undertale to achieve specific results.</p>
    <center><a href="https://thecountofreviews.blogspot.com/2017/07/hacking-undertale-debug-mode-room-codes.html">&raquo; This is where you can read about debug mode &laquo;</a></center>
    <input class="ogabtn" type="button" value="Show" onclick="this.value=this.value=='Show'?'Hide':'Show';" style="width:auto;padding-left:18px;"><div class="spoiler"><div>
        <h2>Part 1-A: What's Debug Mode?</h2>
        <p>Debug mode for undertale isn't that much different from debug mode in any other game. If you want to, you could easily complete a genocide route by setting your HP to 999</p>
        <p>I also changed my name to something I normally can't. I did this by undertale.ini and the save file. Make sure you do both or it won't work!</p>
        <p>To get into debug mode there's a hex code in the game's data that needs to be changed from a 00 to a 01. Once it is, you can go on in and play. Do things like press delete in battle to give yourself 999 HP, press F7 to give yourself 500 gold(you can keep doing this), press F or P to make the game go fast, press F10 to turn off collision, press F9 to turn off currently playing sound, and press insert and delete to teleport back and forth between rooms! It's a blast!</p>
        <h2>Part 1-B: Debuggin' Around the Underground</h2>
        <p>I was able to get some odd results from going to the next room <i>(I guess they meant teleporting from room to room?)</i>. See, you can do it during cutscenes, since it's not like the game has traditional cutscenes. But, you won't be able to move (which makes being able to save anywhere with S, and load anywhere with L, very helpful).</p>
        <p>I did this on accident during the scene where Toriel hugs you. I got stuck so I went back thinking I could continue the scene. No. She was stuck there, mid-gonnaopenthedoor animation, with no collision, and the door wouldn't open. So I went ahead. I went so far ahead I accidentally went out of the ruins. I went back though. From there I actually caused the cutscene where you meet Sans to happen again because I also went back and exited the ruins again, playing the cold open title sequence. Another fun time I had was jumping to the next room repeatedly in snowdin, where I accidentally ended up in Sans' room, which played the Papyrus coming in to see what the commotion is cutscene. But, I teleported out, into the Inn room where you sleep, then to the front desk of the Inn, which then had... Papyrus say the Inn Lady's dialogue, and then the rest of the dialogue he was supposed to say in Sans' room.</p>
        <p>I also encountered the strange thing. Pressing Spacebar in the rainy area will cause your reflection to change to what appears to be Chara/The Fallen Child with shadowed eyes. This may have been meant to be a feature during the genocide route that was cut from the final game. Who knows, though.</p>
        <h2>Part 2-A: Room Codes?</h2>
        <p>Now, you can also edit your save file and undertale.ini to go to specific rooms. This is good for going to see specific FUN events, but also for getting to inaccessible rooms! Now, it should be noted that most of them are blocked by a "dogcheck" value, that makes the game display the Annoying Dog when loading a save that says you're in that room. BUT, with the same hex editor used to get into debug mode, you can disable the dog check.</p>
        <h2>Final Part: Naturally I Knows The Hacker</h2>
        <p>There are a few things you'll need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/">A hex editor, I used this.</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=584103897">This handy guide for setting up Debug Mode.</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=644079685">THIS handy guide for removing Dogcheck and going to inaccessible rooms.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Step 1. In <tag>c:/Users/Username/AppData/Local/UNDERTALE</tag> you will find <tag>file0</tag>, your save file, and <tag>undertale.ini</tag> which you'll also need.</p>
        <p>Step 2. Go to undertale in your steam library, and right click it, selecting properties. Then go to the local files tab, and click on browse local files. You might also want to back up local files before you do this. You'll find data.win there. That's what you use your hex editor on.</p>
        <p>Step 3. Follow the guides for turning on Debug Mode and removing Dogcheck.</p>
        <p>Step 4. Edit the fun value in undertale.ini to your desired number. Then, open file0 with notepad or wordpad. Count 36 lines down, that's the one you want. That's Flag5, the fun flag, which needs to be set to the same number as the fun value in undertale.ini, or it won't work. The flags start right after your weapon and armor, as you can see in the save structure list, so if you can memorize where that is which shouldn't be hard, since there are two double digit numbers followed by 0s, you'll be able to find flag5 easily as it's the 6th line from there. Line 36, remember! You can edit your name from this file too, make sure it's ALSO both save file and undertale.ini.</p>
        <p>Step 5. Find the room code in your save file. This one's way easier. It's the second to last line of the save file. With this, you can edit your room number! Once again, make sure you edit both save file and undertale.ini.</p>
        <p>Step 999. If you manage to break your game I hope you backed up the files. Be very careful when editing hex codes, make SURE you got the right ones or you'll change something you shouldn't.</p>

        <h3>Extracting UNDERTALE.exe</h3>
        <nar>Note: You can skip this part if UNDERTALE is already extracted. You can find this by checking for a bunch of .oggs in the folder you start with. If there's a bunch, it's already extracted.</nar>
        <nar>So, you've read this far, and you want to get to UNDERTALE's debug mode. Well, first thing's first, you're going to have to go to your local content for UNDERTALE. This is usually found at this location:</nar>
        <nar>C:/Program Files(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Undertale.</nar>
        <nar>Another alternative if you don't know where you've installed Steam, go to your Library, right-click on UNDERTALE and press Properties. Go to "Local Content", and then click "Browse Local Content". It will then open up an explorer window leading you to the executable.</nar>
        <nar>Next, you should already have a zip extractor, like WinRAR.[www.rarlab.com] That's what I used to extract the executable. Go to the folder, and right-click on the executable. Then, click "Extract Here" to extract it to the folder it's currently in. Although it's possible, I don't recommend it, as extracting it will extract a new UNDERTALE.exe, so you should try pressing "Extract Files" and select where it should be extracted.</nar>
        <nar>WARNING: If you go past this point without backing up your game, you may break your game. Proceed with caution. I know I didn't.</nar>
        <nar>Once you've extracted UNDERTALE.exe, it should ask you if you want to replace a new executable with the old one. Rename the new one. You'll need it for later. Once you're done extracting, rename the new executable (whatever).exe to UNDERTALE.exe, and replace it in your UNDERTALE directory. But, this doesn't enable debug mode. What REALLY enables debug mode is actually in data.win.</nar>
        <h3>Hex-editing Data.win</h3>
        <nar>So, you've made it this far and you want to enable debug mode. Well, if you have already extracted UNDERTALE.exe and got data.win, you'll need a hex editor. I personally would prefer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/">HxD</a>,[mh-nexus.de] but anything will work as long as it can hex-edit. Open data.win with your hex editor, and find 0x725D8C (00725D8C) or 0x725B24 (00725B24) if you're running an older version of the game, and change it to 01. Finding this might be challenging at a glance, but the easiest way to do it (with HxD) is to right-click at the left of the screen where all the numbers are listed, and select "Select block." Once you do that, a box should pop up. Put in 00725B24 as the staring offset and the ending offset, and press OK.</nar>
        <nar>Once you've changed the value, go to the folder you have extracted UNDERTALE and find the executable that was in the UNDERTALE.exe you have extracted. For reference, the executable you extracted is around 3,163 KB. The executable you usually play UNDERTALE with is usually way bigger because it has all the files, including data.win inside of it. Replace the big executable with the small one, and start the game. If it has worked, you should have all the debug commands! Congratulations. After this, if you want to revert, just change the value back to 00.</nar>
        <h3>Debug Mode Features</h3>
        <nar>All of the Fun events will trigger, regardless of what your Fun level is set in your save file.</nar>
